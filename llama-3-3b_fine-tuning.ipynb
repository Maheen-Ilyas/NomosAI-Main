Ratnaparkhi, for the respondents Nos.\nMarch 15.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by MUDHOLKAR J.\nThe appellants who are admittedly displaced persons from West Pakistan were granted quasi permanent allotment of 24 standard acres and 15 3/4 units in the village of Raikot in Ludhiana District in 1949.\nTheir father Sardar Nand Singh who was 42 330 found entitled to quasi permanent allotment of 40 standard acres and 5 1/4 units of land was given quasipermanent allotment in another village named Humbran in the same district.\nThe two villages are, however, 25 miles or so distant from each other.\nNand Singh, therefore, made an application for consolidation of his lands with those of the appellants in the village Raikot.\nDuring the pendency of this application he died and after his death, the, application was continued by the appellants.\nThis application was rejected by the Assistant Custodian on July 23, 1951 on the ground that no land was available in the village Raikot.\nA revision petition preferred by the appellants against the order of the Assistant Custodian was dismissed by the Additional Custodian on August 20, 1952.\nOn October 7, 1952 the appellants preferred a revision application before the Custodian General.\nDuring the pendency of the revision application the Additional Custodian for the State of Punjab cancelled the allotment of fourteen quasi permanent allottees of the village Karodian in the same district on the ground that these persons were entitled to allotment of suburban land a had been wrongly fitted in the village Karodian.\nActing suo motu the Additional Custodian made an order on October 31, 1952 cancelling the order of allotment of land in the village Raikot made in favour of the appellants in the year 1949 and instead allotted to them land in Karodian in substitution of :,the lands at Raikot and of the lands allotted to their father.\nThe land allotted was out of the land released upon the cancellation of allotment of lands in favour of the aforementioned 14 allottees.\nThese fourteen allottees preferred an application for review of the order cancelling their allotment on the ground that this cancellation was a result of misapprehension of the actual facts and that they were not entitled to allotment of suburban lands at all.\nThe appellants also preferred an application for review of the order cancelling their quasi permanent allotment in the village Raikot.\nThe Additional Custodian for the State of Punjab recommended to the Custodian General the restoration 331 of the land to the 14 allottees which had been taken away from them by reason of cancellation of the allotment in their favour by the order dated October 31, 1952.\nThe Additional Custodian admitted that these persons were not entitled to allotment of suburban land and that consequently their allotment had been wrongly made but referred the matter back to the Additional Custodian for decision.\nThe application made by the appellants was kept pending till the decision of the application of the 14 allottees of Karodian.\nThe Additional Custodian, however, dismissed the application on the ground that r. 14(6) of the Evacuee Property Rules which came into force on July 22, 1952, stood in the way of cancellation of the allotment in favour of the appellant.\nOn December 17, 1954, the Deputy Custodian General, before whom these allottees had preferred an application for revision, revised the order of the Additional Custodian and restored to the 14 allottees of Karodian the land which had been originally allotted to them.\nand allotment of which had been cancelled earlier.\nAs a result of this order the allotment of Karodian land made in favour of the appellants automatically stood cancelled.\nOn January 6, 1955, the appellants moved the Deputy Custodian General for calling up their review application and for revising the order of October 31, 1952 passed by the Additional Custodian cancelling the allotment of Raikot lands which had originally been made in their favour in the year 1949.\nConsequent upon the cancellation of the appellants'allotment of the Raikot land they were allotted to respondents 2 to 4.\nThese persons were, therefore, impleaded as parties to the proceedings before the Deputy Custodian General.\nBy a judgment and order dated November 8, 1957 the Deputy Custodian General dismissed the review application of the appellants.\nIt is this judgment and order that has been challenged by the appellants in this appeal.\nThe question of whether the Deputy Custodian General was justified in dismissing the review application of the appellants is the only issue in dispute before us.\nThe Deputy Custodian General, in his judgment, held that the Additional Custodian had been justified in cancelling the allotment in favour of the 14 allottees of Karodian on the ground that they were entitled to allotment of suburban land and that the Additional Custodian had also been justified in allotting to the 14 allottees of Karodian the land originally allotted to the 14 allottees of Karodian and that the order of the Additional Custodian cancelling the allotment in favour of the 14 allottees of Karodian was a valid exercise of his discretion under the rules.\nThe Deputy Custodian General, however, held that the Additional Custodian was not justified in cancelling the allotment in favour of the appellants on the ground that the Additional Custodian had not been justified in allotting to the 14 allottees of Karodian the land originally allotted to the 14 allottees of Karodian.\nThe Deputy Custodian General, therefore, held that the Additional Custodian was not justified in cancelling the allotment in favour of the appellants and dismissed the review application of the appellants.\nThe question to be determined by us is whether the Deputy Custodian General was justified in dismissing the review application of the appellants.\nIn our opinion the Deputy Custodian General was not justified in dismissing the review application of the appellants.\nThe Additional Custodian had cancelled the allotment in favour of the 14 allottees of Karodian on the ground that they were entitled to allotment of suburban land and had allotted to them the land originally allotted to them.\nThe Additional Custodian had also cancelled the allotment in favour of the appellants on the ground that no land was available in the village of Raikot for consolidation of the lands of the appellants and the father of the appellants.\nThe Additional Custodian had also cancelled the allotment in favour of the 14 allottees of Karodian on the ground that they were entitled to allotment of suburban land.\nThe Additional Custodian had also allotted to the 14 allottees of Karodian the land originally allotted to them.\nThe Additional Custodian had, therefore, cancelled the allotment in favour of the appellants and\nActual: The appellants who are displaced persons from West Pakistan, were granted quasi permanent allotment of some lands in village Raikot in 1949.\nOn October 31, 1952, the Assistant Custodian cancelled the allotment of 14 allottees in village Karodian, and also cancelled the allotment of the Appellants in Raikot but allotted lands to them in village Karodian, and allotted the lands of Raikot to other persons.\nThe 14 allottees of village Karodian as well as the appellants applied for review of the orders of cancellation of their allotment.\nThe application of the 14 allottees was dismissed.\nThey preferred a revision to the Custodian General who cancelled the appellant's allotment (1) Cal.\n926. 329 in Karodian and restored the allotment of the 14 allottees on December 17, 1954 Thereupon,, on January 6, 1955, the appellants moved the Custodian General for calling up their review application and for revising the order of October 31, 1952, cancelling their allotment in Raikot.\nThe Custodian General refused to revise the order on the ground that his power to revise had been taken away by the.\nThe appellants contended that the, Custodian General had the power to revise the order.\nHeld, that after the enactment of the,, the Custodian General ceased to have the power to cancel allotments.\nBy, the issuing of a notification under, section 12(1) of this Act, the Fight, title or interest of the evacuee in the property specified in the notification was extinguished and the property vested absolutely in the Central.\nGovernment.\nThe right of the Custodian manage the property under the, came to an end

result of a letter written by the Inspector of Mines on August 18, 1941, the plaintiffs made an inquiry and came to know that the defendants had encroached upon their coal mines on the northern side and removed coal from the encroached portion and had rendered the remaining coal of the encroached portion unworkable.\nOn those allegations, they asked for the following reliefs: (a)That the intermediate boundary line between the plaintiffs'coal land and the defendants'coal land be ascertained and fixed.\n(b)That the area encroached upon by the defendants be ascertained and the defendants be directed to vacate the same,.\n(c)That a permanent injunction be issued against the defendants restraining them from encroaching upon the plaintiffs'coal land and cutting and removing coal therefrom.\n(d)That an enquiry be made and the quantity of coal cut and removed by the defendants from the plaintiffs'coal land as also the quantity of the coal rendered unworkable be ascertained and a decree for the value thereof by way of damages be granted to the plaintiffs against the defendants.\nThe defendants denied that they had encroached upon the plaintiff,'coal land and stated that the suit was barred by limitation.\nThey further pleaded that the 495 plaintiffs would not be entitled to any damages.\nThe learned Subordinate Judge held that the defendant had encroached upon the plaintiff'coal land, that the suit was not barred by limitations and that they would be entitled to the reliefs prayed for.\nOn appeal, the High Court of Patna accepted all the findings of the learned Subordinate Judge and dismissed the appeal.\nHence the present appeal.\nThe first question that arises for consideration is whether the defendants had encroached Upon the plaintiffs'coal land.\nThe answer to this question depends upon the correct, delineation of the boundary line between the plaintiffs'leasehold and the defendants'leasehold.\nIt is common case that the southern boundary of the appellants'leasehold is conterminous with the northern boundary of the respondents'lease hold.\nLearned counsel for the appellant contends that the said boundary should be fixed solely with reference to the boundaries given in the lease of 1894, whereas learned counsel for the respondents contends that no plan has been annexed to the said lease and, therefore, the boundary could more satisfactorily and definitely be fixed with reference to the plans annexed to the subsequent lease deeds executed in favour of the successors of Jugal Kishore Lal.\nThe High Court of Patna, on the other hand, accepted the view that the boundary should be fixed solely with reference to the boundaries given in the lease of 1894.\nWe are of the opinion that the High Court of Patna was right in holding that the boundary should be fixed solely with reference to the boundaries given in the lease of 1894.\nThe said boundary was an express part of the lease and was not open to any doubt or ambiguity.\nThe subsequent leases did not in any way affect the boundaries of the original lease.\nTherefore, the High Court of Patna was right in holding that the boundary should be fixed solely with reference to the boundaries given in the lease of 1894.\nThe second question that arises for consideration is whether the suit is barred by limitation.\nThe suit was filed by the plaintiffs on April 20, 1946, and the letter of the Inspector of Mines dated August 18, 1941, was not produced before the Court until November 30, 1946.\nIt is true that the suit was not filed before the date of the letter of the Inspector of Mines, but the plaintiffs had knowledge of the fact that the defendants had encroached upon the plaintiffs'coal land and had removed coal from the encroached portion.\nThe plaintiffs knew that the defendants had rendered the remaining coal of the encroached portion unworkable.\nTherefore, the plaintiffs had knowledge of the fact that the defendants had committed the tort of encroachment and had removed coal from the plaintiffs'coal land and had rendered the remaining coal of the encroached portion unworkable.\nIt is true that the letter of the Inspector of Mines dated August 18, 1941, was an important piece of evidence.\nHowever, the plaintiffs had knowledge of the fact that the defendants had committed the tort of encroachment and had removed coal from the plaintiffs'coal land and had rendered the remaining coal of the encroached portion unworkable.\nTherefore, the plaintiffs had knowledge of the fact that the defendants had committed the tort of encroachment and had removed coal from the plaintiffs'coal land and had rendered the remaining coal of the encroached portion unworkable.\nThe suit was filed on November 30, 1946, and the letter of the Inspector of Mines dated August 18, 1941, was not produced before the Court until November 30, 1946.\nTherefore, the suit was not filed before the date of the letter of\nActual: The appellants and the respondents were owners of adjoining collieries and the suit out of which the present appeal arose was one brought by the respondents for certain reliefs on the allegation that the appellants had encroached upon their coal mines and removed coal from the encroached portion and that they came to know of the said encroachment and removal of coal after they had received the letter dated August 18, 1941, from the Inspector of Mines.\nThe appellant denied the encroachment and pleaded that the suit was barred by limitation inasmuch as the respondents had knowledge of the encroachment in 1932 then there was a survey by the Department of Mines.\nThe trial judge found on evidence that the proceedings in 1932 had nothing to do with the matter, held that article 48 of the Limitation Act applied to the suit and that the appellants had failed to prove that the respondents had knowledge of the sinking of the quarries and pits in the encroached land and decreed the suit.\nThe High Court on appeal accepted the finding of the trial court and although it placed the burden of proving knowledge on the part of the respondents beyond the prescribed time on the appellants, nevertheless proceeded on the assumption that the initial burden to prove that they had knowledge of the said encroachment within the period was on the respondents and affirmed the decree of the trial court.\nHeld, that the burden of proof had not been misplaced.\nUnder article 48 of the Indian Limitation Act, which prescribes a three years'limitation from the date of the knowledge, the initial onus is obviously on the plaintiff to prove that date since it would be within his special knowledge.\nMoreover, under section 3 of the Act, which makes its obligatory on the court to dismiss a suit barred by limitation, even though such a plea is not set up in defence, it is for the plaintiff to establish that the suit is not so barred.\nLalchand Marwari vs Mahant Rampur Gir, pat.\n(P.C.) 312 and Rajah Sahib Perhalad Seim vs Maharajah Rajender Kishore Singh, (1869) 12 M.I.A. 292, referred to.\nUnder the there is an essential distinc tion between burden of proof as a matter of law and pleading and as a matter of adducing evidence and under section 101 of the 493 Act the burden in the former sense is always on the plaintiff and never shifts, but the burden in the latter\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInput: Appeals Nos. 45 and 46 of 1959.\nAppeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated March 25,

In fact, they contend that the goods were purchased by them as agents for the buyers and that therefore the property in the goods did not pass to the sellers.\nIn so far as this contention is concerned, the law is also clear.\nIf the seller acts as an agent for the buyer, then the sale is not a sale by the seller but a sale by the buyer and the property in the goods does not pass to the seller.\nThe goods remain the property of the seller, the agent, throughout the transaction and the sale is only a transfer of the right to sell the goods.\nTherefore, the goods did not pass into the possession of the sellers and the property in the goods did not pass to the sellers.\nIn view of this, we are bound to hold that the purchase tax assessed on the purchase of castor oil for the sum of Rs. 6,47,509 1 6 is invalid and should be quashed.\nIn view of this, we are bound to quash the sales tax assessed on the sales of cotton for Rs. 68,493 2 6 and the purchase tax assessed on the purchase of castor oil for the sum of Rs. 6,47,509 1 6.\nThe appeal is allowed. The respondents are directed to refund the sales tax and the purchase tax assessed on the sales of cotton for Rs. 68,493 2 6 and on the purchase of castor oil for the sum of Rs. 6,47,509 1 6.\nThe appeal is also allowed in part.\nThe judgment of the Court is that the sales tax and purchase tax assessed on the sales of cotton for Rs. 68,493 2 6 and on the purchase of castor oil for the sum of Rs. 6,47,509 1 6\nActual: The respondents firm claimed exemption from Sales Tax under article 286(i)(b) of the Constitution in respect of sales 925 made by them of cotton and castor oil on the ground that the sales were on F.O.B. contracts under which they continued to be the owners of the goods till those crossed the custom barrier and entered the export stream.\nThey also contested the purchase tax to which they were assessed under section 10(b) of the Bombay Sales Tax Act.\nThe High Court upheld the contention of the respondents regarding the Sales Tax but held that they were liable to pay purchase tax.\nOn appeal by both the parties Held, that the goods remained the seller's property till those had been brought and loaded on board the ship and so the sales were exempted from tax under article 286(i) of the Constitution.\nThe word \" a person \" in section 10(b) of the Bombay Sales Tax Act had been correctly interpreted as \" a registered dealer \" and the purchasing dealers had been rightly assessed to purchase tax.\nThe normal rule in F. 0.\nB. contracts was that the property was intended to pass and did pass on the shipment of the goods.\nThe presumption in F. 0.\nB. contracts was that it was the duty of the buyer to obtain the necessary export licence, though in the circumstances of a particular case that duty might fall on the seller.\nH.O.

(ii) that there was a quarrel in a play of cards; (iii) that he purchased a sword; and (iv) that he deposited the sword at the Police Station.\n206 Ajit Singh, P.W., 5 deposed about the purchase of the cycle and about a dispute taking place between Sheo Sahai and the appellant on account of the latter's demanding the return of Rs. 10/ which had been paid towards the sale price as the balance of the sale price had not been paid and the deal was cancelled by Sheo Sahai in accordance with the oral contract.\nAjit Singh bears no enmity with the appellant.\nIn fact, none of the prosecution witnesses is alleged to bear enmity with the appellant.\nPaley Singh, P.W. 6, is a relative of the appellant and he deposed that the appellant had told him that he had killed Sheo Sahai and that he had given the sword to Ujagar Singh, which he had kept in his house.\nUjagar Singh, P.W. 7, is a neighbour of the appellant and he deposed that the appellant had told him that he had killed Sheo Sahai and had given the sword to him.\nThe evidence of Ujagar Singh was not relied on by the High Court, but the learned Sessions Judge had placed considerable weight on this extra judicial confession.\nHowever, the High Court had a better view of the case as it held that the entire report dictated by the appellant was inadmissible in evidence as a confessional statement, and that the evidence relied on by the High Court was sufficient to establish the guilt of the appellant.\nThe High Court, therefore, was not wrong in dismissing the appeal and confirming the conviction and sentence of the appellant.\nThe case of Ram Singh, as presented before us, is an appeal by special leave from the judgment and order of the Allahabad High Court in Criminal Appeal No. 1782 of 1960 and Referred No. 125 of 1960.\nThe case of Ram Singh is one of murder under section 302, I.P.C.\nThe evidence of the prosecution consists of the evidence of Ajit Singh, Paley Singh and Ujagar Singh, P.W. 5, 6 and 7 respectively.\nThese three witnesses have deposed that the appellant had told them that he had killed Sheo Sahai.\nThe motive for the murder was that the appellant had demanded Rs. 10/- as the balance of the sale price of a cycle which had been sold to the deceased, but the latter had refused to pay the balance of the sale price, thereby cancelling the deal.\nThe extra judicial confession made by the appellant to Paley Singh and Ujagar Singh is that he had killed Sheo Sahai and had given the sword to them.\nThe High Court had dismissed the appeal of the appellant and confirmed the conviction and sentence of the appellant under section 302, I.P.C.\nWe are of the opinion that the High Court was right in dismissing the appeal of the appellant and confirming the conviction and sentence of the appellant.\nThe High Court had relied on certain portions of the report dictated by the appellant at the Police Station and had considered those portions together with the motive and the evidence about the purchase of the sword by\nActual: The appellant was tried for murder.\nThe facts established were that there were quarrels between the appellant and the deceased over the purchase of a cycle and in a play of cards that the appellant had purchased a sword a day earlier and that he had deposited the sword stained with human blood at the police station shortly after the murder.\nEvidence was also led of an extra judicial confession made by the appellant to one U but the High Court did not place reliance on it as it did not feel sure of it though it observed that a perusal of the statement of U showed that it was very likely that what he stated may have happened.\n^ Held, that the statement of U regarding the extra judicial confession was erroneously rejected by the High Court.\nExtra judicial confessions were not usually considered with favour but such a confession coming from a person who had no reason to state falsely and to whom it was made in circumstances which tended to support his statement could be relied upon.\nThe extra judicial confession in the present case was supported by the facts established, and these together fully established the guilt of the appellant.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInput: Civil Appeal No. 50 of 1961.\nAppeal by special leave from the Award dated March 10, 1959, of the Industrial Tribunal.\nKozhikode, in I.D.

brief facts necessary for present purposes are these.\nThe appellant in a saw mill carrying on business in Kozihkode in 824 the State of Kerala.\nOne Sankaran was in the employ of the appellant as a crosscutter.\nIt is said that on June 21, 1958, Sankaran came drunk to they mill and abused the Engineer, the Secretary and others and threatened them with physical violence.\nHe was caught hold of by other workmen and taken outside.\nIt is said that he came again a short time later at 4 30 p.m. and abused the same persons again.\nThereupon the appellant served a charge sheet on Sankaran on June 24, 1958 acting out the above facts and asked him to show cause why his services should not be terminated on account of his grave indiscipline and misconduct.\nSankaran gave an explanation the same day denying the allegations of fact made against him, though he admitted that he had come to the mill at the relevant time for taking his wages for that week.\nOn June 25, 1958 Sankaran was informed that in view of his denial, a departmental inquiry would be held and he was also placed under suspension pending inquiry.\nThe same day Sankaran protested against his suspension and requested that in any case the departmental inquiry should be expedited.\nAs no inquiry was held till July 2, 1958, Sankaran again wrote to the appellant to hold the inquiry as early as possible.\nOn July 8, 1958, the appellant terminated the services of Sankaran under r. 18 (a) of the Standing Orders without holding any departmental inquiry and the order was communicated to Sankaran the same day.\nIn that order the appellant informed Sankaran that the proposed inquiry, if conducted, would lead to further friction and deterioration in the rank and file of the employees in general and also that maintenance of discipline in the undertaking would be prejudiced if he was retained in the service of the appellant, and therefore it considered that no inquiry should be held.\nA dispute was then raised by the union which was referred to the industrial tribunal for adjudication by the Government of Kerala in October 1958.\nThe tribunal held that 825 something seemed to have happened on the afternoon of June 21, 1958 but there was no evidence to prove what had actually happened.\nIt further held that the appellant had intended to take disciplinary action against the workman but subsequently departmental proceedings were dropped and action was taken under r. 18(a) of the Standing orders.\nThe tribunal was of the view that this was a colourable exercise of the power given under r. 18(a) to the appellant and therefore its action could not be upheld as a bona fide exercise of the power conferred.\nThe tribunal also pointed out that no attempt was made before it to defend the action taken under r. 18 (a) by proving the alleged misconduct.\nTwo witnesses were produced before the tribunal in connection with the alleged misconduct, but the tribunal did not rely on them on the ground that the important witnesses, namely, the Engineer, the Secretary and other members of the staff whose evidence would have been of more value had not been produced and no explanation had been given why they were not produced.\nThe tribunal therefore held that on the facts it could not come to the conclusion that Sankaran had come drunk to the mill and abused or attempted to assault either the Engineer or the Secretary or other officers.\nIn the result the order of discharge was set aside and Sankaran was ordered to be reinstated.\nThe appellant thereupon applied for special leave which was granted; and that is how the matter has come up before us.\nThe main contention of the appellant is that it is entitled under r. 18 (a) of the Standing Orders to dispense with the service of any employee after complying with its terms.\nRule 18 (a) is in these terms: \"When the management desires to determine the services of any permanent workmen 826 receiving 12 as.\nor more as daily wages, otherwise than under rule 21, he shall be given 14 days notice or be paid 12 days wages.\n\" It may be mentioned that r. 21 deals with case of misconduct and provides for dismissal or suspension for misconduct and in such a case the workman so suspended is not entitled to any wages during the period of suspension.\nThe claim thus put forward by the appellant is that it was entitled to terminate the services of Sankaran under r. 18 (a) and hence the action of the tribunal in setting aside the order of discharge is erroneous.\nThe contention of the respondent, Sankaran, is that the action of the appellant in terminating his services without holding any departmental inquiry is an exercise of arbitrary power and is not justified under r. 18 (a) of the Standing Orders.\nThe main point in dispute between the parties is the interpretation of the provisions of r. 18 (a) of the Standing Orders.\nThe respondent, Sankaran, contends that the action of the appellant in terminating his services without holding any departmental inquiry is an abuse of power and is not justified under r.  18 (a) of the Standing Orders.\nOn the other hand, the appellant contends that it is entitled under r. 18 (a) of the Standing Orders to dispense with the service of any employee after complying with its terms.\nWe are now required to determine which of the two contentions is correct.\nWe may now proceed to examine the provisions of r. 18 (a) of the Standing Orders in order to see how it should be interpreted.\nUnder r. 18 (a) the management is given the option of terminating the services of an employee with 14 days notice or by paying 14 days wages.\nHowever, the question is whether the management can terminate the services of an employee without holding any departmental inquiry under the provisions of r. 18 (a).\nThe provision of r. 18 (a) is clear that if the management wants to terminate the services of an employee, it must either give him 14 days notice or pay him 14 days wages.\nHowever, the provision of r. 18 (a) is silent as to whether the management must hold a departmental inquiry before terminating the services of an employee.\nBut the provision of r. 18 (b) provides that the management may terminate the services of an employee without giving notice or pay him wages, if the employee is found guilty of misconduct after a departmental inquiry.\nNow, the question arises whether the provisions of r. 18 (b) can be applied in the case of the termination of services of Sankaran.\nIt is not in dispute that there was no departmental inquiry held before the termination of the services of Sankaran.\nBut the question is whether the termination of the services of Sankaran falls under the provisions of r. \nActual: S, employed by the appellant as a cross cutter in the saw mill was asked to show cause why his services should not be terminated on account of grave indiscipline and misconduct and he denied the allegations of fact.\nHe was thereafter informed about a department enquiry to be held against him and was suspended pending enquiry.\nPurporting to act under r. 18(a) of the Standing Orders, the appellant terminated the services of S, without holding any departmental enquiry.\nThe industrial tribunal to which the dispute was referred held, that action taken, after dropping the proposed departmental proceedings was not bonafide and was a colourable exercise of the powerconferred under r. 18(a) of the Standing order and since no attempt was made before it to defend such action by proving the alleged misconduct, it passed an order for reinstatement of S, The appellant contended that as the termination was strictly in accordance with the terms of contract under r. 18(a) of the Standing Orders, it was entitled to dispense 823 with the service of an employee at any time by first giving 14 days notice or, paying 12 days wages.\n^ Held, that the employer's decision to discharge the employee under r. 18(a) of the Standing Orders after dropping the enquiry intended to be held for misconduct was clearly a colourable exercise of the power, and an employer could not press his right purely on contract and say that under the contract he has unfettered right \"to hire and fire\" his employees, right was subject to industrial adjudication and even a power like that granted by r. 18(a) of the Standing orders in this case was subject to the scrutiny of industrial courts.\nEven in a case of this kind the requirement of bona fides was essential and if the termination of service was a colourable exercise of power, or was a result of victimisation or unfair labour practice, the tribunal had jurisdiction to intervene and set aside such termination.\nBuckingham and Carnatic Co.

Inspector, S.N. Singh, along with Masood Murtaza, Sub Inspector of Police, Bulandshahr on May 12, 1956, in connection with a case against Messrs Greenwood Publicity, they accidentally discovered a large number of letters and postcards and also the five registered letters in question.\nAt the time of the search the appellant who happens to be a trade union official, was not in Bulandshahr but was away on leave at Delhi in connection with a postal conference.\nThese articles were found in an almirah, the key of which was produced by the appellant's father.\nThe articles were not listed at the spot but were taken to the Kotwali in a sealed packet and later on listed there.\nA number of other articles were also seized at that time but we are not concerned with them as they have no connection with the charges against the appellant.\nBriefly, the appellant's defence in all these cases is that there are two factions in the Bulandshahr post office and that these articles were planted by the opposite party.\nAccording to him, the planting must have occurred in the Kotwali when the Sub Inspector purported to make a list of the articles seized from the house in which the appellant lives.\nFurther, according to him, neither the house nor the almirah from which the articles are said to have been 411 seized was in his exclusive possession.\nHe stated and that fact is not denied that the house which consists of two rooms only has been rented in his father's name, that both of them live in those two rooms and that the almirah was in his father's possession inasmuch as the key was produced by him.\nOn behalf of the appellant Mr. B. C. Misra has raised the following six points: (1) That on the findings arrived at by the High Court no offence under section 52 of the Post Office Act has been made out.\n(2) That it has not been established that the five registered letters were in the exclusive possession of the appellant.\n(3) That the search was illegal inasmuch as it was in contravention of the provisions of sections 103 and 165 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.\n(4) That in examining the appellant the Ad ditional Session Judge did not comply with the requirements of section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.\n(5) That the High Court has not found that there were compelling reasons for setting aside the appellant's acquittal.\n(6) The sentences in the three cases having been ordered to run consecutively the total sentence is excessive.\nWe will deal with the last four points first.\nSo far as the alleged illegality of the search is concerned it is sufficient to say that even assuming that the search was illegal the seizure of the articles is not vitiated.\nIt may be that where the provisions of'sections 103 and 165 of the Code of Criminal Procedure have been contravened the evidence so obtained may be deemed to be inadmissible in evidence.\nBut even if the evidence so obtained is inadmissible, the evidence obtained from the articles seized in the search would still be admissible as they were in the exclusive possession of the accused and were, therefore, relevant to the case.\nAs the accused had not claimed the privilege against self-incrimination the articles seized in the search would also be admissible in evidence.\nTherefore, even if the search is found to be illegal, the conviction of the accused is not liable to be quashed on this ground.\nRegarding the examination of the accused, the provisions of section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure are applicable only to the examination of the accused after he has been arrested and the provisions of this section are in no way relevant to the present case.\nTherefore, the last two points do not require any discussion.\nNow so far as the first point is concerned we are of the opinion that the High Court was not justified in finding that the five registered letters in question were in the exclusive possession of the accused.\nThe accused has stated that the house in which the accused lives is rented in his father's name and that the accused and his father live in those two rooms only. 412\nThe accused's father has stated that the almirah in which the articles were found was in his possession and that the key was produced by him.\nTherefore, it cannot be said that the five registered letters in question were in the exclusive possession of the accused.\nMoreover, the accused has stated that he was not in Bulandshahr at the time of the search and that he was away in Delhi in connection with a postal conference.\nIt is, therefore, not possible for the accused to have been in possession of the five registered letters in question at the time of the search.\nTherefore, the High Court was not justified in finding that the five registered letters in question were in the exclusive possession of the accused.\nAs we have seen, the High Court has set aside the acquittal of the accused in all the three cases and has convicted him for offences under section 52 of the Act.\nThe High Court has sentenced the accused to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of one year in each case.\nThe sentences have been ordered to run consecutively and the total sentence is excessive.\nTherefore, the High Court should have reduced the sentences of rigorous imprisonment in each of the three cases and should have sentenced the accused\nActual: The appellant, a postman, and I,is father were living in the same house.\nCertain undelivered postal articles were re covered from an almirah in the house, the key of which was produced by the father.\nThe appellant was tried and convicted of an offence under section 52 Post Offices Act for secreting postal articles.\nThe appellant contended that since it had not been proved that he had been entrusted with these articles the offence under section 52 was not made out and that lie could not be held guilty of secreting as he was not in exclusive possession of these articles.\nHeld, that entrustment was not an essential ingredient of the offence under section 52.\nWhere the legislature intended to make entrustment an ingredient of the offence it had used appropriate words to make it clear.\nIt had used no such words in section 52.\nTo secrete means to hide.\nIn a case like the present, the retention of an undelivered postal article in an almirah for an inordinately long period would be tantamount to hiding that article.\nHeld, further, that the appellant was not in exclusive possession of the postal articles and no inference could be drawn 409 that he had secreted them.\nAs the key was produced by the appellant's father it could not be inferred that the appellant was in joint possession of the almirah much less that he was in exclusive possession of it.\nNo inference could be drawn from the fact that the almirah contained certain other articles belonging to the appellant as it also contained a large number of articles belonging to the father.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInput: l Appeals Nos.\n15 to 19 of 1962.\nAppeal from the Judgment and order dated October 10, 1958, of the

Shroff, Mangaldas and Hiralal were partners in a firm of solicitors.\nAmarchand died on July 7, 1949.\nThereafter the partnership was carried on by Mangaldas and Hiralal up to November 30, 1949, and on December 1, 1949, Ramesh son of Amarchand who had by then qualified as a solicitor joined the firm as the third partner.\nAfter the death of Amarchand the arrangement between the various partners in regard to the realisations of the old outstandings was that in respect of the work done up to the death of Amarchand the realisations were to be divided amongst Amarchand, Mangaldas and Hiralal, in respect of the work between July 8, 1949, and November 30, 1919, the realisations were to be divided between Mangaldas and Hiralal 'and in respect of work done after December 1, 1949, the realisations were to be divided amongst Mangaldas, Hiralal and Ramesh.\nThe firm kept its accounts on cash basis.\nFor the five assessment years 1950 51 to 1954 55 the following amounts were received : Rs. 37,847/, As.\n43,162/, Rs. 34,899/, Rs. 13,402/ and 702 Rs. 32,523/ by the heirs and legal representatives of Amarchand out of the outstandings.\nThe Income tax Officer sought to tax these realisations.\nFor the assessment years 1950 51 and 1951 52 he assessed the amounts in the hands of the heirs and legal representatives of Amarchand as a Hindu undivided family.\nAgainst that order an appeal was taken to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and then to the Appellate Tribunal.\nThe two members of the Tribunal agreed in holding, though for different reasons, that the amounts were not the income of the Hindu undivided family but merely represented inheritance or realisations of the assets of Amarchand.\nThe matter was not pursued further by the Revenue but sometime later proceedings were started by the Income tax Officer under section 34 in respect of the same income in the hands of \"Amarchand N. Shroff by his heirs and legal representatives\".\nThe status of that entity was taken to be that of an individual and not Hindu undivided family.\nThe various amounts were assessed to income tax in the hands of the respondents under section 34(1) (b) read with section 24B of the Income tax Act.\nThe assessments so made were for the assessment years 1950 51, 1951 52, 1952 53, 1953 54 and 1954 55: On appeal the Appellate Assistant Commissioner held that.\nthe notice under section 34 could validly be served only for the assessment years 1950 51 and notices for the subsequent years were invalid.\nThe assessments for 1951 52 to 1954 55 were therefore quashed.\nThe Commissioner of Income tax took an appeal to the Appellate Tribunal and the Tribunal held that assessment could not be made on Amarchand and that section 24B had no application to the income received after the death of Amarchand and that it was capital receipt and not revenue receipt.\nThe order of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner was therefore upheld, On the application of the Commissioner of 703 Income tax the following question of law was referred to the High Court : \"Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the sums of Rs. 37,847/, Rs. 43,162/, Rs. 34,899/, Rs. 13,402/ and Rs. 32,523/ received by the heirs and legal representatives of Amarchand N. Shroff from the firm were not taxable income in the hands of the heirs and legal representatives as Hindu undivided family under section 24B of the Income tax Act, 1922, and whether the assessment made by the Income tax Officer under section 34 of the Income tax Act for the assessment years 1950 51, 1951 52, 1952 53, 1953 54 and 1954 55 in respect of the income received from the firm by the heirs and legal representatives of Amarchand N. Shroff was correct.\"\nThe High Court, by its judgment, held that the amounts were not the income of the Hindu undivided family but mere inheritance or realisations of the assets of Amarchand.\nThe High Court also held that the notice under section 34 could be validly served only for the assessment years 1950 51 and notices for the subsequent years were invalid.\nThe High Court, however, held that the assessments made for the assessment years 1951 52 to 1954 55 were correct.\nThe High Court, however, also held that the amounts received were capital receipts and not revenue receipts.\nIt is against this judgment of the High Court that the present appeals have been filed by the Revenue.\nThe main grievance of the Revenue is that the High Court erred in holding that the amounts received by the heirs and legal representatives of Amarchand were not the income of the Hindu undivided family and in holding that the notice under section 34 could be validly served only for the assessment years 1950 51.\nThe Revenue is also of the opinion that the High Court erred in holding that the amounts received were capital receipts and not revenue receipts.\nThe main grievance of the Revenue is that the High Court erred in holding that the amounts received by the heirs and legal representatives of Amarchand were not the income of the Hindu undivided family and in holding that the notice under section 34 could be validly served only for the assessment years 1950 51 and the High Court erred in holding that the amounts received were capital receipts and not revenue receipts.\nThe main grievance of the Revenue is that the High Court erred in holding that the amounts received by the heirs\nActual: Sub section (1) of section 24B of the Indian Income tax Act, 1922, provided that where a person dies his heirs and legal representatives ate liable to pay out of the estate of the deceased the tax assessed as payable by the deceased or any tax which would have been payable under the Art by the deceased if he had not died.\nA who, was one of the three partners in a firm of solicitors died.\non July 7,1949, and thereafter the partnership was carried on by the other two partners till December 1, 1949.\nwhen R, son of A, joined the firm as the third partner.\nAfter the death of A the arrangement between the various partners in regard to the'realisations of the old out standings was that in respect of the work done up to the death of A the realisations were to be divided between A and the other two partners.\nThe firm 700 kept its accounts on cash basis For each of the five assessment years, 1950 1955, certain amounts were received by the heirs and legal representatives of A out of the out standings.\nProceedings were started by the Income tax Officer under section 34 of the Indian Income tax Act, 1922, in respect of the aforesaid.\nincome, and the various amounts were assessed to income tax in the hands of the respondents, the heirs and legal representatives of A, under section 34 (1) (b) read with section 24B of the Act, for the five respective assessment years, on the footing that the amounts which were received by the heirs and legal representatives of A after his death should be deemed by virtue of the words in sub section\n(1) of section 24B to be income received by A and liable to tax under that sub section.\nHeld, that the words \"or any tax which would have been payable by him under this Act if he had not died\" under section 24B(1) of the Indian Income tax Act, 1922, are restricted to the income received by the deceased person before his death and to the income received after his death by his heirs and legal representatives in the \"previous year\" and which had not been assessed but would have been assessed as income received by him, if death had not taken place.\nThe provisions of section 24B do not extend to tax liability of the estate of a deceased person beyond the previous or the account year in which that person dies.\nApart from section 24B no assessment\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInput: Appeals, Nos. 275 276 of 1963.\nAppeals by special leave from the judgment and order dated May 2, 1960 of the Kerala High Court in Income tax Referred case No. 98 of 1955(M).\nsection T.

Hidayatullah, J. delivered a Dissenting opinion.\nSARKAR J.\nThese two appeals arise out of assessments of the appellant to income tax for the years 1948 49 and 1949 50.\nThe question in these appeals is whether on the facts to be presently stated, the appellant was entitled to relief under section 25(4) of the Income tax Act, 1922.\nThe appellant claimed relief under section 25(4) contending that it had transferred its business to a limited company with effect either from November 13.\n1947 or February 13, 1948, by an instrument executed on February 7, 1948.\nThe claim was rejected by the Income tax Officer and by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and also by the Income tax Appellate Tribunal on appeal to it.\nThe appellant then moved the Tribunal to refer a, certain question to the High Court at Madras under section 66(1) of the Act but that application was rejected.\nIt then moved the High Court under section 66 (2) of the Act and the High Court directed the Tribunal to refer the following question for determination by it: \"Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the assessee is not entitled to relief under section 25 (4) of the Indian Income tax Act, and to what extent?\" The Tribunal duly drew up a statement of case and referred the question along with it to the High Court.\nThere were really two references as there were two cases before the Tribunal.\nThese however were heard together by the High Court and disposed of by one judgment.\nThe High Court held that the appellant was not entitled to any relief under section 25 (4).\nThe present appeals are from the judgment of the High Court.\nThe facts have to be stated at some length but before we do that we think it would be profitable to set out the statutory provisions concerned.\nThough we are directly concerned with sub sec.\n(4) of section 25, a consideration of subsec.\n(3) of that section will throw useful light on the matter 96 in question and so we set both these sub sections out below: section 25 (3) Where any business, profession or vocation on which tax was at any time charged under the provisions of the Indian Income tax Act, 1918,.. is discontinued, then, unless there has been a succession by virtue of which the provisions of sub section (4) have been rendered applicable no tax shall be payable in respect of the income, pro fits and gains of the period between the end of the previous year and the date of such discontinuance.. (4) Where the person who was at the commencement of the Indian Income tax (Amendment) Act, 1939 carrying on any business, profession or vocation on which tax was at any time charged under the provisions of the Indian Income tax Act, 1918, is succeeded in such capacity by another person, the change not being merely a change in the constitution of a partnership, no tax shall be payable by the first mentioned person in respect of the income, profits and gains of the period between the end of the previous year and the date of such succession Both these sub sections gave a further right to the assessee but with that right we are not concerned and shall, there fore, make no more reference to it.\nNow it will be seen that under sub sec.\n(3) the discontinuance of the business gave rise to a relief from taxation in respect of its income provided however that there had not been a succession to the business as mentioned in sub sec.\n(4) which, as will later be seen, has to be a succession taking place after April 1, 1939.\nThe succession contemplated in sub sec.\n(4) again must have taken place before the discontinuance for if the business is discontinued it ceases to exist and cannot be succeeded to.\nSub section (4) requires certain conditions to be fulfilled before a claim to relief under it can be made.\nAs the present appeals relate only to a business carried on by a 97 firm, in discussing these conditions we will omit all refer ences to the professions, vocations and owners of businesses other than firms.\nSub sec. (4) requires that the business must have been carried on by the assessee at the commencement of the Indian Income tax (Amendment) Act, 1939.\nIt also requires that the succession must be by virtue of which the provisions of sub sec.\n(4) have been rendered applicable.\nFurther, the succession must be after April 1, 1939.\nIt will be seen that the question of what constitutes a succession is not simply a question of the change of a partner in a firm.\nThe question is whether there has been a transfer of the business itself.\nIn the present case, the business of the assessee was a business of a firm carried on by the assessee and his partners.\nThe assessee contended that the business was transferred to the limited company on February 13, 1948.\nThe assessee also contended that the business had been carried on by the assessee and his partners up to February 13, 1948.\nThe assessee further contended that the business had been carried on by the assessee and his partners from February 13, 1948, with the limited company.\nIt is clear that the assessee was carrying on the business of the firm up to February 13, 1948.\nIt is equally clear that the business of the firm had ceased to exist on February 13, 1948, with the assessee and his partners.\nThe question is therefore whether the business had been transferred to the limited company on February 13, 1948.\nThe assessee further contended that the business had been carried on by the assessee and his partners with the limited company from February 13, 1948, and that the business had been carried on by the limited company from February 13, 1948, onwards.\nThis contention is clearly wrong. The business of the firm had ceased to exist on February 13, 1948, and the business had been transferred to the limited company. It cannot be said that the business had been carried on by the assessee and his partners with the limited company from February 13, 1948, onwards.\nIn other words, the business of the firm had ceased to exist on February 13, 1948, and the business had been transferred to the limited company. The assessee was no longer carrying on the business of the firm.\nThe business of the limited company had not yet begun to be carried on.\nThe assessee was not carrying on the business of the firm\nActual: By section 25 (4) of the Income tax Act, \"Where the person who was at the commencement of the Indian Income tax (Amendment) Act, 1939.\ncarrying on any business, profession or vocation in which tax was at any time charged under the provisions of the Indian Income tax Act, 1918, is succeeded in such capacity by another person, the change not being merely a change in the constitution of a partnership, no tax shall be payable by the first mentioned person in respect of the income, profits and gains of the period between the end of the previous year and the date of such succession.\" A firm bearing the same name as the appellant firm, had been carrying on business from before 1918 and had paid tax on that business under the Income tax Act, 1918.\nThe firm did three kinds of businesses, namely, (a) in piece goods, yam as general merchants, 92 (b) in the manufacture and sale of umbrellas and (c) in the manufacture and sale of soaps.\nThere were various changes in the constitution of the firm between 1918 and 1934.\nIn May 1939 two, documents were executed, one by the then members of the firm, and a stranger H. being exhibit CI and the other by those members alone,.\nbeing exhibit CII.\nIt appeared from exhibit CI that the business in the manufacture and sale of umbrellas and soaps was being carried on from October November 1937 by the parties to it as partners while exhibit CII showed that the parties to it had been carrying on the business in yarn piecegoods and as general merchants as partners from the same time as mentioned in exhibit Cl.\nOn October 30.\n1943 a document styled as an agreement of partnership was executed by five persons who were then the persons interested in the businesses carried on under the instrument of May 30, 1939.\nThis document referred to the two, agreements of partnership of May 30, 1939 and certain subsequent retirements of partners and admissions of new partners and provided that the businesses previously carried on by the two partnerships.\nreferred to in the instruments of May 30, 1939, would thereafter be carried on by one single partnership constituted by the parties to it.\nThereafter all the businesses aforesaid were carried on by this single partnership.\nThe firm constituted by the instrument of October 30, 1943 continued with certain changes in its constitution till February 7, 1948\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInput: Appeals Nos. 884 887 of 1962.\nAppeals from the judgment and decree dated May 2, 1960, of the Rajasthan High Court in Civil Second Appeal Nos.\n268 of 1954, 203 of 1955, 4 of 1954 and 27 of 1954.\nsection K.

he could only export 4,572 maunds and 20 seers of chuni before December 2, 1947.\nThereafter he could not export further as his permit was not extended.\nIt was alleged on behalf of the respondent that the reason why he failed to export the entire 176 quantity of the commodity before December 2, 1947 was due to market conditions and inability to get allotment of railway wagons.\nThe respondent's case further was that as he could not export the entire quantity of 15,000 maunds for which he had paid export duty in advance at the rate of Rs. 2/ per maund, he was entitled to refund of the proportionate export duty for the quantity of 10,427 maunds and 20 seers, which he could not export.\nHis case further was that though he asked the State for refund of this advance duty, the State did not pay back the same to him.\nIn the meantime, rapid constitutional changes took place after August 15, 1947.\nBy May 15, 1949, the United State of Rajasthan was formed including the Matsya Union into which the former State of Dholpur had merged on March 17, 1948.\nThe United State of Rajasthan eventually became the Part B State of Rajasthan on January 26, 1950 when the Constitution came into force.\nEventually when the State refused to refund the amount, the suit was filed, out of which appeal No. 887 has arisen, in January 1952.\nThe respondent claimed refund of Rs. 20,855/ along with interest and costs.\nThe suits were resisted by the State of Rajasthan on various grounds; but we are concerned now only with one ground which alone has been urged before us, namely, that the State of Rajasthan was not bound by any liability which might have arisen against the former State of Dholpur.\nIt was a new sovereign and was not bound by any obligation against the old sovereign of the former State of Dholpur unless it chose to recognise the obligation.\nAs the United State of Raja sthan into which the former State of Dholpur came to be merged in 1949 never recognised the obligations of the former State of Dholpur it was not bound to refund the amount due to the respondents.\nIn reply to this contention of the State, the respondent relied on article 295(2) of the Constitution and other provisions made during the period when mergers were taking place after August 15, 1947 and contended that in view of article 295(2) of the Constitution the State of Rajasthan was bound by the obligation of the former State of Dholpur.\nBefore we refer to the decisions of the courts below with regard to this controversy it would be profitable to examine the provisions of article 295(2) of the Constitution.\nArticle 295(2) provides as under:\n\"(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in article 301, nothing is an offence which is done in the exercise of any right conferred by this article or any other provision of this Constitution in respect of any property owned, acquired or possessed by a citizen of India, or of any property that was, before the commencement of this Constitution, owned, acquired or possessed by a citizen of India, or which may be deemed to be owned, acquired or possessed by a citizen of India as herein after provided.\"\nThe State of Rajasthan argued that under this provision the liability of the State of Rajasthan was not attracted as the State of Rajasthan did not own any property or had not acquired or possessed any property which was owned or acquired or possessed by a citizen of India, or which may be deemed to be owned, acquired or possessed by a citizen of India.\nIt is however to be noted that the State of Rajasthan had not acquired any property prior to its formation and it was not the owner of any property prior to its formation. The liability, however, arose prior to its formation as the former State of Dholpur had entered into an agreement with the respondent to pay the export duty in advance for the export of chuni from the former State of Dholpur.\nThe liability, however, arose prior to its formation and it was not the owner of any property prior to its formation. The liability, however, arose prior to its formation as the former State of Dholpur had entered into an agreement with the respondent to pay the export duty in advance for the export of chuni from the former State of Dholpur.\nThe liability, however, arose prior to its formation and it was not the owner of any property prior to its formation.

C. Setalvad, and R. C. Prasad, for the appellants.\nThe respondent did not appear.\nMarch 24, 1964.\nThe short question which arises in this appeal is whether the term \"wages\" as defined by section 2(vi) of the (No. 4 of 1936) (hereinafter called 'the Act ') includes wages fixed by an award in an industrial dispute between the employer and his employees.\nThis question has to be answered in the light of the definition prescribed by section 2(vi) before it was amended in 1958.\nThe subsequent amendment expressly provides by section 2(vi) (a) that any remuneration payable under any award or settlement between the parties or order of a Court, would be included in the main definition under section 2(vi).\nThe point which we have to decide in the present appeal is whether the remuneration payable under an award was not already included in the definition of wages before the said definition was amended.\nIt is common ground that between the appellant, Sasamusa Sugar Works Ltd., and its workmen, the respondents, an award had been made by an Industrial Tribunal fixing the pay of the employees at Rs. 2/2/ per day, and in pursuance of the said award, the management of the appellant had entered into an agreement with the respondents that effect would be given to the wage structure, prescribed by the said award.\nThis agreement was subsequently published in the Bihar Gazette as a part of the award.\nIn spite of the award and the agreement, the appellant paid its employees only As.\n/ 10 / per day and that led to the present claim made by the respondents under section 15 of the Act.\nThe respondents contended before the payment of wages authority that the refusal of the appellant to pay to them wages at the rate awarded, in substance, amounted to an illegal deduction from their wages and on that basis, they asked for an order from the authority directing the appellant to pay to the respondents the said prescribed wages.\nThe appellant raised two pleas against the respondents'claim.\nIt urged that section 15 of the Act was inapplicable, because the rates of wages fixed by the award did not fall within the\nPrediction: Appeal No. 251 of 1963.\nAppeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated March 20, 1957, of the Patna High Court in Civil Revision No. 40 of 1956.\nM. C. Setalvad, and R. C. Prasad, for the appellants.\nThe respondent did not appear.\nMarch 24, 1964.\nThe short question which arises in this appeal is whether the term \"wages\" as defined by section 2(vi) of the (No. 4 of 1936) (hereinafter called 'the Act ') includes wages fixed by an award in an industrial dispute between the employer and his employees.\nThis question has to be answered in the light of the definition prescribed by section 2(vi) before it was amended in 1958.\nThe subsequent amendment expressly provides by section 2(vi) (a) that any remuneration payable under any award or settlement between the parties or order of a Court, would be included in the main definition under section 2(vi).\nThe point which we have to decide in the present appeal is whether the remuneration payable under an award was not already included in the definition of wages before the said definition was amended.\nIt is common ground that between the appellant, Sasamusa Sugar Works Ltd., and its workmen, the respondents, an award had been made by an Industrial Tribunal fixing the pay of the employees at Rs. 2/2/ per day, and in pursuance of the said award, the management of the appellant had entered into an agreement with the respondents that effect would be given to the wage structure, prescribed by the said award.\nThis agreement was subsequently published in the Bihar Gazette as a part of the award.\nIn spite of the award and the agreement, the appellant paid its employees only As.\n/ 10 / per day and that led to the present claim made by the respondents under section 15 of the Act.\nThe respondents contended before the payment of wages authority that the refusal of the appellant to pay to them wages at the rate awarded, in substance, amounted to an illegal deduction from their wages and on that basis, they asked for an order from the authority directing the appellant to pay to the respondents the said prescribed wages.\nThe appellant raised two pleas against the respondents'claim.\nIt urged that section 15 of the Act was inapplicable, because the rates of wages fixed by the award did not fall within the definition of wages prescribed by section 2(vi) and it also argue,, that the claim of the respondents was barred by limitation.\n421 The authority has found that section 2(vi) includes wages prescribed by the Industrial Tribunal, and so, it has rejected the appellants'contention that the applications made by the respondents were incompetent under section 15 of the Act.\nIn regard to the question of 'limitation, the authority did not decide the said question as a preliminary question, because it held, and, in our opinion, rightly, that it was a mixed question of fact and law, and so, it had to be tried after recording evidence.\nThe appellant challenged the correctness of the conclusion of the authority that the applications made by the res pondents were competent under section 15 of the Act before the Patna High Court by filing a petition under article 226 of the Constitution.\nThe High Court has affirmed the finding of the authority and held that section 15 was applicable to the case, because the wages prescribed by the award did amount to wages as defined by section 2(vi) of the Act.\nOn that view, the writ petition filed by the appellant was dismissed.\nIt is this order which the appellant seeks to challenge before us by its present appeal by special leave.\nSection 2(vi) as it stood at the relevant time, provides, inter alia, that wages means all remuneration, capable of being expressed in terms of money, which would, if the terms of the,contract of employment, express or implied, were fulfilled, be payable.\nMr. Setalvad for the appellant contends that before it is held that the wages prescribed by the award fall under section 2(vi), it must be shown that they constitute part of the terms of the contract of employment, either express or implied.\nThe terms in question need not be express and can be implied; but they must be terms which arise out of the contract of employment, and since an award made by an Industrial Tribunal cannot be said to amount to a contract of employment, the wage structure prescribed by the award cannot fall within the definition prescribed by section 2(vi).\nThat, in brief, is the substance of the argument raised by the appellant.\nWe are not inclined to hold that even under the unamended definition of wages, rates of remuneration prescribed by an award could not be included.\nIn dealing with the question of construing the unamended definition of the term \"wages\", it is essential to bear in mind that the definition of \"wages\" prescribed by section 2(vi) is not exhaustive.\nIt is only when the definition of \"wages\" prescribed by section 2(vi) is found to be exhaustive, that the courts have to look for other definitions contained in other sections of the Act.\nIn this case, it is not necessary to look into other sections of the Act to determine whether the wages prescribed by the award can be described as wages under section 2(vi).\nWe are of the view that the definition of \"wages\" prescribed by section 2(vi) is not exhaustive.\nThe definition of \"wages\" prescribed by section 2(vi) is not exhaustive.\nIn the present case, the remuneration payable under the award was not only remuneration payable under an award or settlement between the parties, or order of a Court, as provided in section 2(vi) (a), but it was also remuneration payable under the award, which was a contract between the employer and the employees.\nTherefore, it is clear that the wages prescribed by the award fall within the definition of wages prescribed by section 2(vi).\nIn other words, the wages prescribed by the award were not only remuneration payable under an award or settlement between the parties, or order of a Court, as provided in section 2(vi) (a), but they were also remuneration payable under the award, which was a contract between the employer and the employees.\nTherefore, it is clear that the wages prescribed by the award fall within the definition of wages prescribed by section 2(vi).\nWe are of the view that the definition of \"wages\" prescribed by section 2(vi) is not exhaustive.\nThe definition of \"wages\" prescribed by section 2(vi) is not exhaustive.\nIn the present case, the remuneration payable under the award was not only remuneration payable under an award or settlement between the parties, or order of a Court, as provided in section 2(vi) (a), but it was also remuneration payable under the award, which was a contract between the employer and the employees.\nTherefore, it is clear that the wages prescribed by the award fall within the definition of wages prescribed by section 2(vi).\nWe are of the view that the definition of \"wages\" prescribed by section 2(vi) is not exhaustive.\nThe definition of \"wages\" prescribed by section 2(vi\nActual: In pursuance of an award made by an Industrial Tribunal fixing the pay of the employees at Rs. 2/2/ per day, the management of the appellant had entered into an agreement with its workmen, that the effect would be given to the wage structure prescribed by the said award.\nIn spite of the award and the agreement, the appellant paid its employees only As.\n/10/ per day and that led to the present claim made by the respondents under section 15 of the Payment of Wages Act.\nThey asked for an order from the payment of wages authority directing the appellant to pay the said prescribed wages.\nAgainst the respondent's claim it was urged by the appellant that section 15 of the Act was inapplicable, because the rates of wages fixed by the award did not fall within the definition of wages prescribed by section 2(vi) of the Act.\nThe authority rejected the appellant's contention.\nThe appellant then challenged the correctness of the conclusion of the authority before the High Court under article 226 of the Constitution.\nThe High Court dismissed the writ petition and affirmed the finding of the authority.\nIt held that section 15 was applicable to the case, because the wages prescribed by the award did amount to wages as defined by section 2(vi) of the Act.\nOn appeal by Special Leave the appellant contended that before it is held that the wages prescribed by the award fall under section 2(vi), it must be shown that they constitute part of the terms of the contract of employment, either express of implied.\nHeld: The argument is not well founded.\nWhen an award is made and it prescribes a new wage structure, in law the old contractual wage structure becomes inoperative and its place is taken by the wage structure prescribed by the award.\nIn a sense, the latter wage structure must be deemed to be the contract between the parties, because that, in substance, is the effect of industrial adjudication.\nThe true legal position is that when industrial disputes are decided by industrial adjudication and awards are made, the said awards supplant contractual terms in respect of matters covered by them and are substituted by them.\nThat being so, it is difficult to hold that the wages prescribed by the award cannot be treated as wages under section 2(vi) of the Act before it was amended.\nThe amendment has merely clarified what was included in the unamended definition itself.\nSouth Indian Bank Ltd. vs A.

Mathur and Ravinder Narain, for the respondent No. 1.\nMarch 24, 1964.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by DAS GUPTA, J.\nThis appeal arises out of an industrial dispute as regards the age of retirement.\nThe first respondent, Shaw Wallace & Co., was incorporated in January, 1946 as a Private Limited Company to take over the business of the partnership firm of the Shaw Wallace & Co., which had been,doing business in India for about 60 years.\nIn July.\n1947 the Private Limited Company was converted into a Public Limited Company.\nThe Head Office of the Company is at Calcutta.\nIt has Branches in Bombay, Delhi and Via Madras.\nThe general practice of the Company both at the Head Office and the Branch Offices appears to have been to retire its employees at the age of 55 though in certain cases the Company in its discretion permitted an employee to continue beyond that age.\nIn September, 1959 an agreement was entered into between the Company and its employees at Calcutta under which the age of retirement was extended to 58 years subject to the employees passing a medical examination on reaching the age,of 55.\nShortly after this the Company's employees at Bombay raised a dispute regarding their retirement age.\nThey claimed that no workman should be retired from service before he bad completed 60 years of age.\nThis dispute was ultimately referred to the Industrial Tribunal, Maharashtra.\nBefore the Tribunal the Company resisted the workmen's claim but submitted that it was agreeable to introduce for its Bombay employees provisions similar to those which had been introduced by agreement for the Calcutta employees retirement at the age of 58 subject to the employee passing a medical examination on reaching the age of 55.\nThe Tribunal has directed that the age of retirement should be 58 but the Company may in its discretion and with the express or implied consent of the employee concerned continue an employee after he attains that age.\nIt is against this decision that the present appeal has been filed by the workmen.\nAs has already been noticed there is no dispute that the age of compulsory retirement should not remain at 55.\nThe dispute is whether it should be fixed at 58 or at 60.\nIt is interesting to refer in this connection to the information that has been collected by the Pay Commission (1957 59) as regards the pensionable ages prescribed under the Pension Insurance Schemes for employees generally or for industrial 426 employees and under social assistance or universal schemes in forty eight countries in 1954.\nAccording to this the pensionable age is 70 in two countries; 67 in another two; 65 in twenty four, 60 in seventeen, 55 in two and 50 in one.\nThus out of 48 countries for which information was available it was found that in 45 countries the pensionable age was fixed at 60 or more.\nAs the Pay Commission Report pointed out: \"This is particularly remarkable, considering that the countries differ widely in demographic constitution, levels of economic development, and climatic and social condition; and it indicates a virtual unanimity of competent opinion that balancing the various factors physiological, economic and social that are relevant, the normal working life should continue up to the age of 60, and may well go on up to 65 years.\nIt is undoubtedly more useful, however, and indeed essential for our present purpose to examine the trends in this matter in our own country and specially in the region in which the present dispute has arisen.\nIn the delicate task of adjust ing needs of the employees to the interests of the employers and what is even more important to the general interests of the country at large, industrial adjudication has to pay special attention to the prevailing practice in the industrial region concerned.\nIf in any particular region employees have been successful in their claim for fixing the age of retirement at 60 this very success is bound to raise in others in the region similar expectations.\nRefusal of similar relief to them is likely to create discontent.\nIt is the endeavour of industrial adjudication to prevent this.\nThat is why on questions of age of retirement and hours of work and other similar matters industrial tribunals attach much weight to what has been done in other industrial concerns in the neighbourhood in recent timeswhether by agreement or by adjudication.\nIn support of their demand for fixing the age of retirement at 60 the workmen tried to show that in recent years at least the tendency in India was to extend the age of retirement.\nThey cited the example of the Railway Employees (Age of Retirement) Rules, 1954 which fixed the age of retirement at 60, the Factory Act, 1948, which by its Section 54 prescribes that no workman shall be compulsory retiired before the age of 58, the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, Section 33-A, which prescribes that no workman shall be compulsorily retiired before the age of 55 plus 10 years of service, the Industrial Disputes Act, 1957, Section 33-A, which prescribes that no workman shall be compulsorily retiired before the age of 55 plus 5 years of service.\nThey also cited the fact that the State of Gujarat had by its Government Resolution No. 1429, dated 20th March, 1959, decided to extend the age of retirement to 60 years for its Government employees.\nIt is thus clear that the State of Gujarat had extended the age of retirement to 60 years for its Government employees and the workmen had cited this as a precedent for the present case.\nThe workmen also pointed out that the employer had submitted that the age of retirement should be fixed at 58 in this case but had agreed to extend the age to 58 years subject to the employee passing a medical examination on reaching the age of 55.\nIt is thus clear that the employer had agreed to a compromise.\nIt was, therefore, submitted that the Tribunal's direction to fix the age of retirement at 58 was not justified and that the Tribunal should have gone for the age of retirement of 60.\nIn the present appeal the employers, on the other hand, have submitted that the Tribunal's direction was proper and that the employers had agreed to the age of retirement being extended to 58 but had not agreed to go beyond that.\nThey have further submitted that the age of retirement of 60 is not in conformity with the general practice of the Company and that the employees in other branches of the Company were not retiring at the age of 60.\nThe question, therefore, is whether the Tribunal was justified in directing the age of retirement to be fixed at 58 and not at 60.\nIn the case of Indian Association of Working Men v. Indian Association of Working Men, [1963] 1 S.T.C. 529 (Bom. H.C.), the Bombay High Court held that the direction of the Industrial\nActual: Shortly after the extension of the age of retirement from 55 to 58 subject to the employee passing a medical examination at 55 in the respondent company's Head Office at Calcutta, their workmen at Bombay branch raised an industrial dispute claiming the extension of their age of retirement from 55 to 60.\nThe dispute was referred to the Industrial Tribunal.\nThe company resisted the claim but was agreeable to introduce similar provisions as introduced at Calcutta.\nThe difficulty in accepting the company's case was the conclusion recorded by the Supreme Court in its earlier decisions that the trend in Bombay region was to fix the age at 60.\nSo the Tribunal considered it to be its duty to enquire whether the conclusion recorded by the Supreme Court was accurate and ultimately persuaded itself to hold that no such trend was established in fact, and directed that the age of retirement should be 58.\nHeld: (i) After careful consideration of all the materials placed on this record, there was nothing to justify any doubt about the correctness of what was said on the earlier occasion by this Court.\nThe approach adopted by the Tribunal in dealing with this aspect of the problem is not very commendable and its present conclusion that what was said by itself on an earlier occasion and was confirmed by this Court in appeal, was in fact inaccurate, is on the whole unsound.\nWhat the Tribunal has failed to notice is that instances which may justify a revision of the judicial opinion expressed on an earlier occasion about a particular trend must be strong and unambiguous and they must speak for the period both before and more particularly after the previous finding had been recorded in the matter.\n(ii) The information furnished by the several documents on this record clearly show a consistent trend in the Bombay region to fix the retirement age of clerical and subordinate staff at 60.\nImperial Chemical Industries (India) Private Ltd. vs Their Workmen, ; and Dunlop Rubber Co.

Elliot Esqr., the Secretary Sadar Board of Revenue N.W.P. Allahabad, to J. Thompson Esqr., Offg.\nSecretary to Lt. Government, N.W.P.\".\nThe pension was paid regularly from year to year by the Government to Babu Har Narain Singh and his heirs.\nDuring the previous year of the assessment year 1949 50, the assessee received a sum of Rs. 36,396/ on account of the aforesaid pension.\nThe Income tax Officer, in spite of the objection of the assessee, held that it was a regular annual income of the assessee and did not fall within the category of agricultural income tax.\nHe observed that \"in fact this income arose from a statutory obligation of the Government to pay it, and although the Government recouped this from the person with whom the land was settled, land in the genealogical tree of Malikana appears in the second degree, its immediate and effective source is the Government's statutory obligation to pay it, and this obligation is not land within the meaning of Income tax Act, vide C.I.T.v.\nRaja Bahadur Karnakhaya Harain Singh(1)\".\nThe assessee appealed to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner who held that \"the alleged cash grant of varying and unspecified amount received by the appellant, in relation to land revenue of Seyedpur now Tehsil of District Ghazipur, clearly fell within the definition of agricultural income under Section 2(1) of the Incometax Act.\" The Income tax Officer appealed to the Income tax Appellate Tribunal.\nThe Tribunal held that the sum of Rs. 36,396/ was chargeable to tax under the Act as the income was not agricultural income for \"although the pension was determined with respect to the quantum of land revenue, the land revenue, in turn, was not the source of the income but the amount of pension was a statutory obligation of the Government to pay, and in the case of C.I.T.v. Raja Bahadur Karnakhaya Harain Singh (1) it was held that the land revenue payable by the assessee was not the source of the income but the amount of land revenue was a tax paid to the Government and the Government was the source of the income.\" The assessee is now in appeal against the judgment of the Tribunal.\nThe question referred by the Tribunal to the High Court was answered in the negative by the High Court. The assessee is now in appeal against the judgment of the High Court.\nIt may be seen from the above that the sum of Rs. 36,396/ was received by the assessee as a pension in the previous year of the assessment year 1949 50. It is the contention of the assessee that the sum of Rs. 36,396/ is not agricultural income. The assessee's case is that the amount of pension was granted by the British Government by virtue of a sanad dated 7th July 1837, and was a statutory obligation of the Government to pay it, and was not derived from any land revenue or agricultural source.\nThe assessee also contended that the income tax Act does not define the term \"agricultural income\". It is the contention of the assessee that the income tax Act defines agricultural income to mean any income which is derived from agriculture. The assessee also contended that the source of the income is not land revenue, but the amount of pension paid by the Government to the assessee, and that this amount is not derived from land revenue, but is a statutory obligation of the Government to pay it.\nThe assessee further contended that the High Court in its judgment in the reference answered the question referred to it in the negative, and that the assessee is now in appeal against the judgment of the High Court.\nThe main point of contention between the assessee and the Revenue is whether the sum of Rs. 36,396/ received by the assessee in the previous year of the assessment year 1949-50 is agricultural income or not.\nThe Revenue's case is that the sum of Rs. 36,396/ is agricultural income. The Revenue's case is that the sum of Rs. 36,396/ was derived from land revenue, and is, therefore, liable to be\nActual: The respondent was the head of a Hindu undivided family and was the descendant of a Jagirdar.\nCertain disputes between the Jagirdar and the Zamindars in the district had been settled in 1837 by a compromise between the British Government and the then Jagirdar, whereby, the Government granted the Jagirdar and his heirs a pension in perpetuity to be calculated on the basis of one fourth of the revenue of the Jagir.\nBy this arrangement the collections from the Jagir became payable by the Zamindars direct to the Government and the Jagirdar and his successors no longer remained the proprietors of the Jagir and became entitled only to a pension.\nThe Income tax Officer assessed the receipt of the pension by the respondent as part of his regular income and rejected the latter's contention that the amount received was agricultural income within the meaning of section 4(3)(viii) of the Income tax Act, 1922.\nIn appeal, the Assistant Commissioner accepted the respondent's contention, but the Tribunal reversed this finding.\nThe High Court, on a reference, decided the issue in favour of the respondent, on the grounds, inter alia, that the right conferred under the compromise of 1837 was a right to a share of one fourth in the net land revenue collections and furthermore, the amount received by the successors of the Jagirdar varied from year to year.\nIn the appeal before the Supreme Court, it was also contended on behalf of the respondent that the amount received was in the nature of a capital receipt, being a payment to the Jagirdar and his successors of compensation for relinquishing the title to the Jagir lands.\nHELD: (i) Under the compromise and arrangement of 1837, the respondent had no interest in the land or in the land revenue payable in respect thereof.\n[704 A] State of U.P.v.\nKunwar Sri Trivikram Narain Singh;,, followed.\nAs the source of the income in this case was the arrangement of 1837, the income could not be held to be derived from land within the meaning of the definition of agricultural income in section 2(1)(a) of the Act.\nEven if the income varied from year to year, the source of the income was still the arrangement and not land.\n[705 G] Maharajkumar Gopal Saran Narain Singh, vs\nC.I.T.

The Tribunal, by the award impugned here, held that the Union was not able to establish that the existing system of work needed any modification.\nThe Port Trust had under its control several docks.\nReference in this judgment will be made to the Prince's and Victoria Docks, the Alexandra Docks, Butcher Island and the Flotilla Crew.\nThese represent different areas of work where different groups of workmen were employed.\nFrom the facts appearing on the record it appears that the Trustees first introduced a two shift system of work in the Alexandra Docks on June 30, 1953 and the same system was extended to the Prince's and Victoria Docks on December 15, 1953.\nPreviously, the shore crew at all these places worked in a single shift and were liable to be called out at 634 any hour of the day or night.\nWhen the two shift system began, each shift of 12 hours was broken up into 8 hours'duty, 2 hours'variable recess and 2 hours'overtime.\nThe hours of rest were kept variable as they depended on the tides.\nIn 1956 the workmen, who were then represented by the Port Trust General Workers'Union, made a demand for a fixed recess of two hours.\nThe Trustees apprehended that this was a device to get 4 hours'overtime and rejected the demand.\nThe General Workers Union was informed that if the demand was pressed a three shift system would be introduced.\nThe workmen then retraced their steps and accepted a 2 hours'variable recess but requested that it should be as near the middle of the shift as possible.\nThe Trustees agreed to accept the hours of rest at fixed hours in the Alexandra Docks but at the Prince's and Victoria Docks they kept it variable agreeing to fix it as near the middle of the duty hours as possible.\nUnder this arrangement the shore crew working at the Prince's and Victoria Docks were informed each day what the period of rest would be on the following day.\nIn explanation of this difference it may be pointed out that the Alexandra Docks work on a system of lock gates which enables the depth of water at the docks to be artificially regulated but the Prince's and Victoria Docks, being tidal, work only at high tide.\nIt was thus possible to fix rest hours at the Alexandra Docks for half the crew different from the rest hours of the other half so that a part of the crew was always available on hand.\nAs the lock gates control the depth of water in the Alexandra Docks, fixed hours of rest could be maintained from day to day except in the monsoon months when the, storm gates had some time to be closed.\nDuring these months recess time at the Alexandra Docks was also variable and was made to coincide with the closure of the storm gates.\nThe workmen at the Alexandra Docks seemed to have accepted a variable recess of two hours but the Port Trust gave a notice under section 9A of the on June 25, 1960 announcing the introduction of variable recess although in the months other than the monsoon months recess was actually at fixed hours.\nThe workmen opposed the change from fixed to variable recess.\nMeanwhile studies were being made and it was found that the work hours at the different Docks were not equal: they were heavier at the Alexandra Docks than at the other docks.\nThe Trustees, therefore, resolved that the shore crew at the Alexandra Docks should work for 8 hours and that there should be a variable recess of one hour and overtime of three hours should be paid.\nThus the 12 hours of the shore crew were broken up into 8 hours of duty, 1 hour of variable recess and 3 hours of overtime.\nIn the case of the Prince's and Victoria Docks, the work hours were lighter and the Trustees decided that the shore crew should work for 8 hours and that there should be a variable recess of 2 hours and overtime of two hours.\nThus the 12 hours of the shore crew were broken up into 8 hours of duty, 2 hours of variable recess and 2 hours of overtime.\nIt is against this system of work that the present dispute arose.\nThe workmen at the Alexandra Docks challenged the variable recess and the overtime of three hours on the ground that the workmen at the Alexandra Docks had accepted a fixed recess of 2 hours in 1956.\nThe workmen at the Prince's and Victoria Docks challenged the variable recess and overtime of two hours on the ground that the workmen at the Prince's and Victoria Docks had accepted a fixed recess of 2 hours in 1956.\nThe Port Trust and the Trustees relied on the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of.\nThe workmen, however, argued that the decision of the Supreme Court did not apply to the present case.\nThe Tribunal, by the award impugned here, held that the Union was not able to establish that the existing system of work needed any modification.\nIn the light of the facts appearing on the record, it is clear that the workmen at the Alexandra Docks were not given fixed recess of 2 hours as they had accepted a variable recess of two hours in 1956.\nThe workmen at the Prince's and Victoria Docks were also not given fixed recess of 2 hours as they had also accepted a variable recess of two hours in 1956.\nThe Port Trust had accepted variable recess at the Alexandra Docks but not at the Prince's and Victoria Docks.\nThe workmen at the Alexandra Docks were not allowed to have fixed recess of 2 hours as this was not what they had agreed to in 1956.\nThe workmen at the Prince's and Victoria Docks were not allowed to have fixed recess of 2 hours as this was not what they had agreed to in 1956.\nThe Port Trust and the Trustees, therefore, had to justify the system of work which had been introduced.\nThe Tribunal, by the award impugned here, held that the Union was not able to establish that the existing system\nActual: The respondent had under its control several docks.\nThe trustees Of the respondent introduced a two shift system of work and that resulted in the crew working in some docks getting 4 hours of overtime in some docks 3 hours of overtime and in others 2 hours of overtime only.\nIn the last category the 12 hours shift wag divided in to 8 hours of work, 2 hours of rest and 2 hours of overtime.\nThe 2 hours period of rest was variable depending on the tides or the exigencies of the work, though the crew were informed each day what the, period of rest would be on the following day.\nThe appellants, who belonged to this category, complained that the breakup of the 12 hours shift into 8 hours of duty, 2 hours of rest and 2 hours of overtime offended the, and that the system of variable recess did not satisfy the requirements of rest which is the basis for fixing statutorily the hours of work in relation to wages.\nThe Industrial Tribunal held that the appellants were not able to establish that the existing system of work needed any modification.\nIn appeal to this Court, HELD: There was no breach of the provision of the and the case of the appellants could not be compared with that of the crew working at the other docks, because, there wag no parallel in the work of the three different sets of crew.\n[643 H] If an employer takes actual work for 8 hours per day on 6 days in a week he complies with the relevant provisions of the Act and the Rules, namely sections 13 and 14 of the Act and rr.\n24 and 25 of the Minimum Wages (Central) Rules 1950, and need not pay overtime.\nHe may go up to 9 hours on any day

over 12 hours in a twelve hour shift.\nThese periods of rest must not be periods during which the workman is on duty and inaction is due to want of work for him, but they must be predetermined periods of inaction during which the workman is neither called upon nor expected to display physical activity or sustained attention.[641 B D] In the present cage the total number of hours of work in a week

(ii) His basic pay as on January 1, 1962 shall be reduced to the extent of the difference between the pay scales of the two scales of pay (ii) The difference shall be reduced from the basic pay as on January 1, 1962 in the manner provided in para 5.350 of the Desai award. (iii) The difference shall be reduced from the basic pay as on January 1, 1959 in the manner provided in para 5.350 of the Desai award. The main point of contention is whether the words \"basic pay as on January 1, 1959\" in para 5.356 of the Desai award are to be taken as the \"basic pay\" of a workman as on January 1, 1959 or \"basic pay\" of a workman as on January 1, 1962.\nWe may now set out the arguments made by the respective parties in this regard.\nFor the appellants, Mr. Gupte contended that the words \"basic pay as on January 1, 1959\" in para 5.356 of the Desai award are to be taken as the \"basic pay\" of a workman as on January 1, 1962. In other words, he contended that the words \"basic pay as on January 1, 1959\" were to be taken as the \"basic pay\" of a workman as on January 1, 1962.\nOn the other hand, Mr. Ramamurthi, the learned counsel for the respondents, contended that the words \"basic pay as on January 1, 1959\" in para 5.356 of the Desai award are to be taken as the \"basic pay\" of a workman as on January 1, 1959.\nIn other words, he contended that the words \"basic pay as on January 1, 1959\" were to be taken as the \"basic pay\" of a workman as on January 1, 1959.\nIt is clear from the above arguments that the two parties are at crossroads as to the interpretation of the words \"basic pay as on January 1, 1959\" in para 5.356 of the Desai award.\nNow, we shall attempt to resolve this controversy by interpreting these words.\nWe may note that the words \"basic pay\" in para 292 of the Sastry award as modified\nActual: The respondent employees made applications under section 33C(2) of the Industrial Disputes Act for determination and computation of the benefit to which they were entitled under the National Industrial Tribunal (Bank Disputes) Award (Desai Award) as they were not satisfied with the fixation of their pay by the appellant bank under para 5.356 of the Desai Award.\nThe Bank claimed that under clause (ii) of para 5.356 of the Desai Award, the adjusted basic pay in,the new scale was not to exceed what point to point adjustment would give an employee on January 1, 1962 and that this being the maximum permissible under cl.\n(ii), cl.\n(iv) could not give an employee more than the maximum arrived at under cl. (ii).\nThe employees on the other hand claimed that they were entitled to what was provided by sub cls.\n(a), (b) and (c) of cl.\n(iv) and the two increments under sub cl.\n(d) and that it did not matter whether what was thus arrived at exceeded the maximum provided under cl.\nThe Labour Court partially accepted the employees'contention and fixed their pay accordingly.\nIn appeal.\nHELD:The decision of this Court in Prakash Chand Mehra's case would govern the interpretation of para 5.356 of the Desai Award also, which is in substance the same as para 292 of the Sastry Award as modified by the Labour Appellate decision.\nThe adjusted basic pay in cl.\n(ii) has to be taken as on January 1, 1959.\nThis follows from the fact that the workman basic pay as on January 1, 1959 cannot be reduced and therefore when cl.\n(ii) speaks of adjusted basic pay it must refer to the same date as in cl.\nFurther cl (iv) which provides for actual calculations starts with words \"subject to rules (i) to (iii)\" and therefore the actual calculations made under cl.\n(iv) must be subject to cls.\n(i) and (ii).\nThis means in effect that the actual fixation under sub cls.\n(a), (b) and (c) of cl.\n(iv) will be subject to cl.\n(i) and cl.\nUnder sub cl.\n(a) of cl.\n(iv) a workman will be placed in the Sastry Award as modified by placing him at the stage in the Sastry Award scale equal to or next above his basic pay as on January 1, 1959 in the scale then in force in the\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInput: Appeal No. 801 of 1963.\nAppeal by special leave from the judgment and decree dated September 2, 1959 of the Madras High Court in Second Appeal No. 774 of 1957.\nT.

On the first two issues, oral and documentary evidence was adduced by the parties.\nThe learned trial Judge examined the whole evidence and came to the conclusion that the grant of the Inam was a personal Inam, and that it was not a grant in favour of the religious endowment within the meaning of the Act.\nThat is how the first two issues were answered in favour of the appellants.\nIn consequence, the learned trial Judge also held that the appellants had proved their title to the suit properties.\nThe alternative plea made by the appellants that they had acquired title to the properties by prescription, was also upheld by the trial Judge.\nIn the result, the appellants'suit was decreed on the 14th February, 1955.\n123 Respondents 1 to 3 preferred an appeal (No. 129 of 1955) in the Court of the Subordinate Judge of Tiruchirappalli against the decree of the District Munsif.\nIn the said appeal, they raised the following issues : whether the grant of the Inam was a personal Inam and not a religious endowment; whether the plaintiffs had acquired title to the suit properties by prescription; and whether the plaintiffs had failed to prove their case under section 87 of the Act.\nThe said appeal was resisted by the appellants.\nThe Subordinate Judge of Tiruchirappalli, after examining the evidence on the record, upheld the findings of the District Munsif and delivered a judgment in favour of the respondents on the 13th November, 1956.\nThe Subordinate Judge's judgment was that the grant of the Inam was not a personal Inam and that it was not a religious endowment within the meaning of the Act.\nHe also held that the respondents had acquired the title to the properties in question by the appointment of the said trustees by respondent No. 4 and by the operation of the provisions of the Act.\nOn the basis of the said findings, the Subordinate Judge also upheld the alternative plea of the respondents that the plaintiffs had not acquired title by prescription.\nThe Subordinate Judge further held that the plaintiffs had failed to prove their case under section 87 of the Act.\nOn this finding, he also dismissed the suit of the appellants.\nThe Subordinate Judge's judgment was appealed by the appellants (by special leave) before this Court.\nThe main issue in the present appeal is whether the grant of the Inam was a personal Inam and not a religious endowment within the meaning of the Act.\nThe Subordinate Judge upheld the finding of the District Munsif that the grant of the Inam was not a religious endowment within the meaning of the Act.\nHowever, in this Court, the learned counsel for the respondents contended that the grant of the Inam was a religious endowment, and that the said endowment had been converted into a personal property by the alienation of the properties from time to time.\nThe learned counsel for the respondents contended that the alienation of the properties had been carried out by the grantee of the Inam and his successors in title, and that the grantee had the power to alienate the properties in favour of any person, including the trustees of the said temple.\nThe learned counsel for the respondents also contended that the properties in suit had been alienated from time to time by the grantee of the Inam and his successors in title and\nActual: The lands in dispute had been granted in inam to a temple.\nBy about 1929 the then manager of the temple disposed of all those properties under various sale deeds, resigned his position and left the village.\nHe was therefore removed from the management of the temple and other persons had taken up the position as de facto managers from 1929.\nAs a result of successive alienations of the properties, the appellants became entitled to them.\nIn 1951, the respondents were appointed trustees of The temple and under the Madras Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Act, 1951, they applied, to the Magistrate, for possession of the properties and the Magistrate ordered delivery of possession.\nBefore the order could be executed the appellants filed the suit in 1954, for a declaration of their title to the properties and for an injunction restraining the respondents from interfering with their possession.\nThe trial Court and the lower appellate Court decreed the suit.\nIn second appeal, the High Court held that the suit was governed by article 134 B of the Limitation Act,, 1908, which was introduced into the Act on 1st January 1929; and that the appellants'claim in regard to the properties covered by the sale deeds of 1917 and 1926.\nshould be rejected, because, the alienees had not acquired title by adverse possession by 1st January, 1929, and is the alienor was still alive, the plea of adverse possession could not be sustained under that article.\nIn appeal to this Court it was contended that article 134 B would not apply to the present case but that article 144 would apply, because, the transfers were effected by the alienor on the'representations that the properties belonged to him as his separate property; and that even if the article applied, the decision of the High Court was erroneous, because the transferor had been removed from management more than 12 years before the suit was filed.\nHELD : Though article 134 B applied to the facts of the case, since the appellants had acquired title to the properties by prescription, the decree passed by the High Court, in so far as it was against the appellants, should be set aside.\nColumn 1 of the article provides for suits brought,, inter alia, by the Tanager of a Hindu religion; or charitable endowment to recover possession of immovable property comprised in the endowment, which has been transferred by a previous manager for valuable consideration.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInput: Appeal No. 381 of 1966.\nAppeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated October 7, 1965 of the Punjab High Court (Circuit Bench) at Delhi in Civil Writ No. 1626 C of 1965.\nM.

No. 1149 of 1965, do not require consideration as the election of the appellant is upheld.\nWe, therefore, dismiss the appeals of the respondent.\nIn the result, the appeals of the respondent are dismissed.\nThe appeals of the appellant are allowed.\nThe respondent is entitled to his costs in both the appeals.\nActual: When item 40 of Part 13 of the Schedule to the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950, declared \"Sunris excluding Sahas\" as a Schduled Caste, it indicates that men of Sunri caste but not those within that caste who formed the smaller caste group of Sahas, are members of a Scheduled Caste.\nIt does not indicate that Sahas are a caste distinct from the Sunri caste, nor was it intended to exclude from Sunris those members of that caste who bore the surname Saha.\n[391 A, D].\nTherefore, when the respondent challenged the election to the West Bengal Legislative Assembly, of the appellant who described himself as a member of the Sunri caste, on the ground that he was a member of the Saha caste group but failed to prove the allegation, it must be held that the appellant was a Sunri by caste and belonged to the Scheduled caste specified in the item, even though he bore the surname Saha.\n[392 D].\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInput: Appeal No. 696 of 1966.\nAppeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated September 13, 1963 of the Madras High Court in Writ Appeal No. IO of 1962.\nP.

transactions of sale which took place before the, transfer of the business under Rule 21 A of the Rules framed in exercise of the powers conferred on the State Government by section 19 of the Act.\nThe respondent purchased, by a registered instrument dated October 5, 1956, the business carried on by one Purushottam Raju under the name All India Trading Company.\nPurushottam Raju was the sole proprietor of the business and had been assessed to sales tax in respect of his turnover for the years 1948 49 and 1949 50.\nThe assessee paid some amounts towards sales tax thus determined, but there remained some arrears of sales tax i.e., Rs. 3836 4 0 for 1948 49 and Rs. 1218 1 9 for 1949 50.\nThe Sales tax authorities attempted to recover the arrears of tax from the respondent as the

under the Letters Patent.\nThe Division Bench consisting of section Ramachandra Iyer, C.J. and Ramakrishnan, J. reversed the judgment of the Single Judge, holding that Rule 21 A of the Sales Tax Rules was illegal and ultra vires and the respondent was not liable to pay the sales tax due from his predecessor in title, Purushottam Raju.\nThis appeal is brought, by special leave, from the judgment of the Division Bench of the Madras High Court dated September 13, 1963 in Writ Appeal No. 10 of 1962.\nRule 21 A was framed by the State Government under the rule making power granted to it under section 19(1) and (2) of the Act.\nRule 21 A reads as follows : \"When the ownership of the business of a dealer liable to pay the tax under the Act is entirely transferred, any tax payable in respect of such business and remaining unpaid at the time of the transfer shall be recoverable from the transferor or the transferee as if they were the dealers liable to pay such tax, provided that the recovery from the transferee of the arrears of taxes due prior to the date of the transfer shall be only to the extent of the value of the business he obtained by transfer.\nThe trans feree shall also be liable to pay tax under the Act on the sales of goods effected by him with effect from the date of such transfer and shall within thirty days of the transfer apply for registration or licence, as the case may be, unless he already holds a certificate of registration or licence, as the case may be.\n\" Section 19 ( 1 ) and 1 9 (2) (c) are to the following effect \"19.\n(1) The State Government may make rules to carry out the purposes of this Act.\n(2) In particular and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing power, such rules may provide for (c) the assessment to tax under this Act of businesses which are discontinued or the ownership of which has changed;\" 664 The first question to be considered in this appeal is whether Rule 21 A is intra vires of the power of the State Government under sections 19(1) and (2) of the Act.\nSection 3(1) of the Act is the charging section.\nIt imposes a liability to pay sales tax on every dealer for each year, and the tax is to be calculated on his total turnover for that year.\nSection 2(b) of the Act defines a \"dealer\" as \"a person who carries on the business of buying, selling.\ngoods\".\nThe word \"turnover\" is defined in section 2(c) of the Act as \"the total value of all goods sold or delivered by a dealer in the course of the business during the year\".\nThe Act also defines a business as \"the carrying on of the trade or business of buying, selling goods\" (Section 2(d)).\nThe term \"business\" has been defined to include a trade or business of any kind, however small or insignificant (Section 2(d)).\nUnder the Act, a dealer is liable to pay tax on his turnover for the year.\nThe sales tax is payable by a dealer who carries on a trade or business, and is payable in respect of the total value of all goods sold or delivered by the dealer in the course of the business during the year.\nThe liability to pay tax arises from the fact that the dealer is carrying on a business and not from the fact that he sells goods.\nThe liability to pay tax arises from the fact that the dealer carries on a business and not from the fact that he sells goods.\nThe liability to pay tax arises from the fact that the dealer carries on a business and not from the fact that he sells goods.\nThe liability to pay tax arises from the fact that the dealer carries on a business and not from the fact that he sells

from the fact that the dealer carries on a business and not from the fact that\nActual: By a registered instrument dated October 5, 1956, the respondent purchased the business carried on by a dealer as defined in the Madras General Sales Tax Act IX of 1939.\nThe dealer had been assessed to sales tax in respect of his turnover for the years 1948 49 and 1949 50 and had paid a part of the sales tax determined as due from him with the balance amount remaining in arrears.\nThe sales tax authorities attempted to recover the arrears from the respondent as the purchaser of the business and although he denied liability, his contention was overruled by the Deputy Commercial Tax Officer.\nHis appeal to the Board of Revenue was also dismissed and he thereafter filed a Writ Petition under article 226 of the Constitution, challenging the orders of the C.T.O. and the Board.\nA Single Bench of the High Court dismissed the appeal but a Division Bench allowed a Letters Patent Appeal holding that Rule 21 A of the Sales Tax Rules under which the arrears were sought to be recovered from the respondent, was illegal and ultra vires the Act.\nIn the appeal to the Supreme Court it was contended, Inter alia, on behalf of the department (i) that Rule 21 A was valid having been made in exercise of the rule making power granted to the State Government under sections 19(1) and 19(2) (c) of the Act whereby it could make rules for the assessment to tax under the Act of businesses which were discontinued or the ownership of which had changed; (ii) that further more under section 10, the whole of the amount outstanding on the date of the default was charged on the property of the person liable to pay the tax; therefore, in the present case, the business which was transferred to the respondent was charged with the payment of sales tax and it was open to the sales tax authorities to proceed against the assets of the business for realising the amount of sales tax due; and (iii) that upon a true construction of the registered instrument dated October 5, 1956, the respondent undertook to pay all liabilities like sales tax imposed in regard to the business.\nHELD: dismissing the appeal: (i) Rule 21 A was beyond the rule making power of the State Government either under section 19(1) or section 19(2)(c) and was therefore ultra vires the Act.\n[666 E F] Although by the amending Act 1

by public notice and by announcement by beat of drums (through loudspeakers.)\" On March 17, 1963, resolution No. 3 was passed fixing octroi limits and number of octroi nakas and their places.\nOn March 18, 1963, the Panchayat wrote to the Collector, Nagpur, seeking his approval to the octroi limits, number of octroi nakas and their places.\nIt appears that the Panchayat started collecting octroi from April 1, 1963.\nOn May 29, 1963, the Company filed an appeal 216 under section 124(5) of the Act, against the levy of octroi duty.\nOn August 8, 1963, the Collector, Nagpur, passed an order by which he approved the octroi limits, the number of octroi nakas and their places, as fixed by the Panchayat.\nThe Panchayat passed resolution No. 8 on August 8, 1963, which approved the Collector's order.\nOn August 20, 1963, the Company filed an appeal under section 124(5) of the Act, against the approval of the Collector's order.\nOn September 13, 1963, the Panchayat passed resolution No. 9, which approved the second order of the Collector.\nOn October 22, 1964, the Company filed a special civil application No. 355 of 1964, under Article 226 of the Constitution, against the Panchayat, and the Collector, and the Standing Committee of the Panchayat, in the Nagpur Bench of the High Court.\nThe High Court, by the impugned judgment, dismissed the special civil application, and held that the Panchayat had the right to levy octroi duty on goods coming within its local limits and that the Collector had acted in accordance with the Act and its rules.\nThe Company has now appealed to this Court against the judgment of the High Court.\nIt is the case of the Company that the Panchayat has no right to levy octroi duty, as the Act does not provide for the imposition of octroi duty and the Rules framed thereunder do not provide for the imposition of octroi duty.\nThe Company has also contended that the Collector should not have approved the levy of octroi duty.\nIt is further contended that the Panchayat has no right to fix octroi limits and the number of octroi nakas and their places.\nThe Panchayat has contended that it has the right to levy octroi duty and to fix octroi limits and the number of octroi nakas and their places.\nThe Panchayat has also contended that the Collector has acted in accordance with the Act and its Rules.\nThe question raised in this appeal is whether the Panchayat has the right to levy octroi duty and to fix octroi limits and the number of octroi nakas and their places.\nTo answer this question, it is necessary to examine the provisions of the Act, and the Rules framed thereunder.\nUnder the Act, the\nActual: The appellant Panchayat levied octroi duty on goods coming within its limits by following the procedure laid down in rr. 3 and 4 of the Maharashtra Village Panchayats Taxes and Fees Rules 1960.\nAlthough the resolution finally levying octroi was passed on February 25, 1963 and the octroi limits were fixed by resolution dated March 17, 1963 the approval of the Collector to the octroi limits as required by r. 21 was not obtained till January 14, 1964.\nWhen the Panchayat began collecting octroi on April 1, 1963 the respondent company appealed under section 124(5) of the Bombay Village Panchayat Act, 1958 to the Panchayat Samita.\nThe appeal was rejected as it was considered time barred under r. 5 of the Taxes & Fees Rules which required an appeal under section 124(5) of the Act to be filed within 60 days of the publication of the notice under r. 4.\nOn further appeal the Standing Committee, Zila Parishad, Nagpur decided in favour of the respondent company on the ground that the Panchayat had not complied with r. 21.\nThe Panchayat filed a writ petition under article 226 of the Constitution.\nThe High Court upheld the findIng of the Standing Committee as to the effect of non compliance with r. 21.\nIt however further held that r. 5 in requiring all appeals under a. 124(5) of the Act to be filed within 60 days of the publication of the notice under section 4 was arbitrary and destructive of the right of appeal and therefore ultra vires.\nThe Panchayat appealed to this Court.\nHeld: (i) Octroi can be validly levied under r. 22 after following the procedure in rr.\n3 and 4 Rule 3 deals only with (i) selection of the tax and (ii) the rate at which it is to be

BHAGAVA, J. delivered a separate Opinion.\nMitter, J. This is an appeal by a certificate granted by the High Court at Calcutta from a judgment and decree in Second Appeal passed by that court in January, 1961.\nThe question before us is, whether the respondent No. 1 was entitled.\nto the benefit of the Calcutta Thika Tenancy Act, 1949, as amended finally by an Act of 1953.\nThe facts necessary for the disposal.\nof this appeal are as follows.\nOn the 18th June 1948, the plaintiff, the appellant before us, instituted Suit No. 292 of 1948 for ejectment of three Persons, namely, Abdul Rahim, Abdul Hamid and Abdul Gaffur, from the property in suit (a parcel of land about 1 cottah 8 chittaks being part of premises No. 6 / 1, Shibtola Lane, Entally, Calcutta).\nIn the notice to quit served on the 7th May, 1948 the first two persons were described as tenants under the plaintiff and the third as a person who had purported to purchase the structures on the land and the tenancy right therein.\nIn the plaint itself, the first two defendants were described as thika tenants.\nNo claim was made for rents or taxes although it was alleged that the same were in arrears.\nThe suit was contested only by the third defendant who filed a written statement in September 1948 contending that the suit was bad for non joinder of parties.\nThe suit was decreed by a Munsif of Sealdah court, 24 Parganas on March 18, 1949 after the Calcutta Thika Tenancy Act of 1949 had come into force on February 28, 1949.\nThe appeal filed therefrom by the third defendant was dismissed by the Subordinate Judge.\nFifth Additional 172 Court, Alipore on November 23, 1949.\nThe decree holder put the decree in execution and recovered possession of the land on December 18, 1949.\nThe Calcutta Thika Tenancy (Amendment Ordinance), 1952 was passed on October 21, 1952 introducing various changes in the Act and substituting a new definition of a thika tenant.\nOn March 14, 1953 the Calcutta Thika Tenancy (Amendment Act), 1953 was passed amending the definition of thika tenant still further and introducing important changes in the Act of 1949.\nThe effect of these provisions will be considered later on.\nBefore the Subordinate Judge, a point was taken that after the coming into force of the Act of 1949, the Rent Controller alone had jurisdiction in respect of ejectment suits as the defendant appellant was a thika tenant.\nThe Subordinate Judge dismissed the plea on the ground that the defendant appellant had not erected the structures on the land and was not a successor in interest of the tenant but only a transferee.\nAbdul Gaffur preferred a Second Appeal to the High Court and this was heard and disposed of by a single Judge of that court on July 21, 1954, long after the Thika Tenancy Ordinance of 1952 and the Amending Act of 1953 had come into force.\nThe learned Judge held that at the time when the appeal of the defendant was disposed of by the Subordinate Judge, the rights of the parties were governed by the Thika Tenancy Act of 1949 and the definition of a thika tenant in that Act was not such as to afford any protection to the appellant.\nIn view of the amendment of the Act in 1953 however.\nthe learned Judge felt that the question whether the appellant was entitled to the benefit of that Act had to be re examined and consequently he remanded the matter to the lower appellate court with a direction that there should be a fresh decision of the case after considering the law applicable and taking further evidence if necessary.\nOn remand, the Subordinate Judge, Seventh Court, Alipore rejected the plea of the landlord that the appellant Gaffur could not be regarded as a thika tenant inter alia on the ground that he had sold his interest by a registered sale deed dated April 12, 1949 to one Subasini.\nOn a consideration of the provisions of the Act and the Ordinance, the Subordinate Judge held that the definition of thika tenant as provided in the Act of 1949 was not applicable to the case of the defendant Gaffur and consequently the plaintiff-appellant could not claim the benefit of the Act.\nThe plaintiff-appellant has now sought a certificate from the High Court to appeal against the finding of the Subordinate Judge and we are asked to consider whether the Subordinate Judge was right in holding that the definition of thika tenant in the Act of 1949 was not applicable to the case of the defendant Gaffur.\nBefore we go into the merits of the case, it is necessary to note that the amendment of the definition of a thika tenant was made in the Amending Act of 1953 and the effect of this amendment will be considered later on.\nNow the question to be decided is whether the Subordinate Judge was right in holding that the definition of thika tenant in the Act of 1949 was not applicable to the case of the defendant Gaffur.\nFor the purpose of this appeal, we shall consider the provisions of the Act of 1949 and the Ordinance as they stood at the time of the trial.\nUnder the Thika Tenancy Act of 1949, a thika tenant is defined as one who has purchased the structures on the land and is holding under the landlord.\nThe Act also provides that a thika tenant shall be entitled to the benefit of the provisions of the Act.\nThe first defendant, Abdul Rahim was described as a thika tenant in the plaint and was described as such in the notice to quit.\nThe third defendant, Abdul Gaffur, however, was described as a person who had purported to purchase the structures on the land and the tenancy right therein.\nIt was also alleged that he had sold his interest by a registered sale deed dated April 12, 1949 to one Subasini.\nIn view of the definition of thika tenant in the Act of 1949, it is clear that Abdul Rahim was a thika tenant and the first defendant's tenancy was recognized and protected by the Act.\nHowever, Abdul Gaffur was not a thika tenant in the sense of the Act, since he had not purchased the structures on the land and was not holding under the landlord.\nTherefore, the Subordinate Judge was right in holding that the definition of thika tenant in the Act of 1949 was not applicable to the case of Abdul Gaffur.\nNow, the question arises as to whether the amendment of the definition of thika tenant\nActual: In June 1948 the appellant instituted a suit against the first respondent and others for their ejectment from the property in suit, On February 28, 1949 the Calcutta Thika Tenancy Act came into force.\nThe first respondent was not a thika tenant within the definition therefore of given in the Act.\nThe suit was decreed by the Munsif in March 1949.\nIn November 1949 the appeal filed by the first respondent was,dismissed by the first appellate court.\nHe then filed a second,,appeal in the High Court which was heard in 1954.\nBefore that the Calcutta Thika Tenancy (Amendment) Act, 1953 was passed.\nUnder this Act the first respondent came within the definition of thika tenant.\nThe High Court remanded the case to the Subordinate Judge for trying the case in the light of the amended Act.\nThe Subordinate Judge held that the first respondent was a thika tenant and could not be ejected as none of the grounds mentioned in section 3 of the Act had been established by the appellant.\nThe latter appealed to the High Court and urged that with the omission of section 29 in the 1953 Act Civil Courts became, unable to remit ejectment suits to the Rent Controller with the result that the Act as amended could not apply to pre Act suits.\nThe High Court however took the view that after the omission of sections 28 and 29 from the Act suits for eviction before civil courts became infructuous and, accordingly, dismissed the appeal.\nThe appellant with certificate came to this Court.\nThe questions that fell for consideration were: (i) whether the tenant could take the benefit of section 3 in a pre Act suit, (ii) whether in view of the omission of sections 28 and 29 from the Act the civil courts had jurisdiction to try such a suit.\nHELD:Per Wanchoo C.J. & Mitter J. (i) While it is a general principle of law that statutes are not to operate retrospectively so as to defeat vested interests; such operation may be given by express enactment or by necessary implication from the language employed.\nThe language of section 3 leaves no room for doubt that it is retrospective since it expressly states that notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force or in any contract, a thika tenant will be liable to ejectment on grounds specified therein and not otherwise.\n[179 D E; 180 F G].\nKnight vs Lee\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInput: ivil Appeals No. 625630 of 1967.\nAppeals by special leave from the judgment and order dated'March 6, 1967 of the Orissa High Court in O.J.C.

judgment of a Full Bench of the High Court of Judicature at Calcutta quashing the conviction of the respondent by the Special Court established under sec tion 3 of the West Bengal Special Courts Ordinance, 1949, (Ordinance No. 3 of 1949) which was replaced in March, 1950, by the West Bengal Special Courts Act, 1950, (West Bengal Act X of 1950) (hereinafter referred to as \"the Act\").\nThe respondent and 49 other persons were charged with various offences alleged to have been committed by them in the course of their raid as an armed gang on a certain factory known as the Jessop Factory at Dum Dum, and they were convicted and sentenced to varying terms of imprison ment by the Special Court to which the case was sent for trial by the Governor of West Bengal by a notification dated 26th January, 1950, in exercise of the powers conferred by section 5 (1) of the Act.\nThereupon the respondent applied to the High Court under article 226 of the Constitution for the issue of a writ of certiorari quashing the conviction and sentence on the ground that the Special Court had no jurisdiction to try the case inasmuch as section 5 (1), under which it was sent to that Court for trial, was uncon stitutional and void under article 13 (2)as it denied to the respondent the equal protection of the laws enjoined by article 14.\nThe High Court by a Full Bench consisting of the Chief Justice and four other Judges quashed the conviction and directed the trial of the respondent and the other accused persons according to law.\nHence the appeal.\nThe Act is intituled \"An Act to provide for the speedier trial of certain offences \", and the preamble declares that \"it is expedient to provide for the speedier trial of cer tain offences \".\nSection 3 empowers the State Government by notification in the official gazette to constitute Special Courts, and section 4 provides for the appointment of spe cial judges to preside over such courts.\nSection 5, whose constitutionality is impugned, runs thus: 290 \"5(1) A Special Court shall try such offences or classes of cases, as the classes of offences or cases State Government may by general or special order in writing, direct.\n(2) No.direction shall be made under sub section (1) for the trial of an offence for which an accused person was being tried at the commencement of this Act before any court but, save as aforesaid, such direction may be made in re spect of an offence, whether such'offence was committed before or after the commencement of this Act.\n\" Sections 6 to 15 prescribe the special procedure which the court has to follow in the trial of the cases referred to it.\nThe main features of such procedure which mark a departure from the established procedure for criminal trials under the Code of Criminal Procedure are the elimination of the committal procedure in sessions cases and the substitu tion of the procedure laid down in the Code for trial of warrant cases by the Magistrate, trial without jury or assessors, restriction of the court's power in granting adjournments, special powers to deal with refractory accused and dispensation of de novo trial on transfer of a case from one Magistrate to another.\nThe Act was brought into force in March, 1950, and the respondent was charged with the offence under section 3 (1) (b) of the Act, which reads thus: \"Whoever, being armed with any firearm or other weapon, on any occasion, intends to commit or instigates any person to commit any offence punishable under this Act, shall be deemed to be guilty of an offence and shall be liable to imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine.\"\nThe respondent was convicted under this section, and the main ground of objection raised by the respondent is that the Special Court had no jurisdiction to try the case as the direction made by the State Government under section 5 (1) was not made in writing, as required by the section, and, therefore, the conviction and sentence were void under article 13 (2) of the Constitution.\nThe High Court, in its judgment, held that section 5 (1) of the Act did not require the direction to be made in writing, and that the direction was valid under section 5 (2) which permitted directions to be made in respect of an offence for which an accused person was being tried at the commencement of the Act, and, therefore, the Special Court had jurisdiction to try the case.\nThe High Court further held that the direction made by the State Government under section 5 (1) was not void under article 13 (2) of the Constitution because it was not an attempt to deny the respondent the equal protection of the laws as guaranteed by article 14, but was merely a direction to try the case in a special court which was a departure from the established procedure of criminal trials under the Code of Criminal Procedure.\nThe question which is raised by this appeal is whether section 5 (1) of the Act is constitutional under article 13 (2) of the Constitution, and whether the direction made by the State Government under that sub-section is valid under that article.\nThe argument of the counsel for the respondent is that section 5 (1) is unconstitutional because it violates article 13 (2) of the Constitution by denying to the respondent the equal protection of the laws. The argument is that the direction made by the State Government under section 5 (1) was not made in writing, and that the absence of such writing was sufficient to render the direction void under article 13 (2).\nThe argument of the counsel for the State of West Bengal is that section\nActual: The West Bengal Special Courts Act (X of 1950) was entitled \"An Act to provide for the speedier trial of cer tain offences,\" and the object of the Act.\nas declared in the preamble, was \"to provide for the speedier trial of certain offences\".\nSection 3 of the Act empowered the State Government by notification in the official gazette to con stitute Special Courts, and sec.\n5 provided that \"A Special Court shall try such offences or classes of offences or cases or classes of cases, as the State Government may by general or special order in writing, direct.\n\" The Act laid down a procedure for trial before Special Courts which was different in several respects from that laid down by the Criminal Procedure Code for trial of offences generally.\nThe respondent, who was convicted by a Special Court which tried his case under a notification issued by the Government under sec. 5, contended that the said section was unconsti tutional and void inasmuch as it contravened article 14 of the Constitution, which provides that \"the State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protec tion of the laws within the territory of India\".\n285 Held, per FAZL ALl, MAHAJAN, MUKHERJEA, CHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR and BOsE JJ.\n(PATANJALI SASTRI C.J., dissenting) Section 5 (1) of the West Bengal Special Courts Act, 1950, contravenes article 14 of the Constitution and is void inasmuch as (per FAZL ALl, MAHAJAN, MUKHERJEA, and CHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR JJ.) the procedure laid down by the Act for the trial by the Special Courts varied substantially from that laid down for the trial of offences generally by the Code of Criminal Procedure and the Act did not classify, or lay down any basis for classification, of the cases which may be directed to be tried by the Special Court, but left it to the uncontrolled discretion of the State Government to direct any case which it liked to be tried by the Special Court.\nDAs J. Section 5 Il) of the Act, in so far as it empowered the State Government to direct \"offences\" or \"classes of offences\" or \"classes of cases\" to be tried by a Special Court, does not confer an uncontrolled and unguided power on the State Government but by\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInput: iminal Appeal No.112 of 1965.\nAppeal by special leave from the jurisdiction and order dated April 29, 1965 of the Allahabad High Court in Criminal Misc.

Limited.\nvs Workmen(1) where it was held : \"It is now well settled that the principle of industry cum region has to be applied by an Industrial Court, when it proceeds to consider questions like wage structure, dearness allowance and similar conditions of service.\nIn applying that principle, industrial courts have to compare wage scales prevailing in sinular concerns in the region with which it is dealing, and generally speaking similar concerns would be those in the same line of business as the concern with respect to which the dispute is under consideration.\nFurther, even in the same line of business, it would not be proper to compare (for example) a small struggling concern with a large flourishing concern.\n\" The Tribunal, in giving its decision, kept this principle in view, but came to the finding of fact that there were no other concerns in the same line of business as the Company in the region which could be compared with the Company.\nThe Tribunal found that there are only two other paper mills in the region.\nThey are Titaghur Paper Mill No. 3 situated at Chaudwar, and the J.K. Paper Mills at Rayagada.\nThe Tribunal found that the Company is an old established business carrying on manufacture of paper on a very large scale.\nThe Titaghur Paper Mill No. 3 started production only in April, 1960, while the J.K. Paper Mills at Rayagada started production in 1961 62.\nThese two Paper Mills were, therefore, both of very recent origin compared with the Company.\nThe strength of their labour force and the annual production were also very mueh lower.\nEven the profits earned were much smaller.\nOn these facts, the Tribunal held that it would not be proper to compare the wage structure for these Paper Mills with that of the Company.\nTIffs is a finding of fact recorded by the Tribunal and nothing has been shown by learned counsel for the Company which would induce this Court to interfere with that finding of fact.\nThe second point taken in the appeal was with regard to the method of fixation of minimum wages, which was that the Tribunal failed to neutralise the rise in cost of living on the basis of the price index of the area, to the extent of at least 90%.\nWe shall deal with this point in the course of this judgment.\nBefore we take up the second point, we must find out whether the first point is worth anything.\nIt is difficult to see how the first point can be argued in the light of the finding of fact recorded by the Tribunal that there are no identical industry in the region comparable with the Company, and that the two Paper Mills in the region were of very recent origin and were much smaller in scale.\nHowever, to enable us to take up the second point which was urged by learned counsel for the Company, we must see whether the minimum wages fixed by the Tribunal are not in accordance with the minimum wages being paid in the region.\nFor this purpose, we must examine the findings of the Tribunal in this regard.\nThe Tribunal found that the minimum wages being paid in the region are Rs. 4-0-0 and Rs. 4-25-0 per day for workmen and Rs. 5-0-0 and Rs. 5-25-0 per day for supervisory staff respectively.\nThe Company contended that these rates were not the minimum wages being paid in the region, and that the minimum wages being paid in the region are Rs. 5-00-0 and Rs. 5-25-0 per day for workmen and Rs. 6-00-0 and Rs. 6-25-0 per day for supervisory staff respectively.\nIt was urged that the Tribunal should have taken into consideration the wages paid by the Titaghur Paper Mill No. 3, situated at Chaudwar, which was also a paper mill in the region, and the J.K. Paper Mills at Rayagada.\nThe Tribunal, however, found that the Titaghur Paper Mill No. 3 and the J.K. Paper Mills at Rayagada were of very recent origin, and that they were much smaller in scale.\nIt was also found that the wages paid by these two Paper Mills were much lower than the wages paid by the Company.\nTherefore, the Tribunal found that these two Paper Mills are not comparable with the Company.\nThe Tribunal also found that the Company is an old established business, carrying on manufacture of paper\nActual: An industrial dispute regarding fixation of wages and bonus, between the respondent paper mills and its workmen, the appellants, was referred to the Industrial Tribunal in October, 1962, and the reference included a dispute about bonus payable for the years 1962 63 and 1963 64.\nThe Tribunal held: (1 ) that there were in the region no'other concerns in the same line of business which could be compared with the respondent but that there were three collieries, a steel plant, a cement factory and an aluminum company in the region which were comparable with the resportdent, that as the minimum wage in those industries which was about Rs. 95 was above that of the respondent, a revision of the minimum wage in the respondent mills was justified.\nthat such minimum wage should be fixed for the price index prevailing at the time of the award taking 100 as the basic index for the year 1939, and that on that basis, the basic wage and dearness allowance should be Pa. 73, and that Pa. 11 was payable as production bonus; (2) that the dearness allowance element need not be linked to the price index, but that wage should be fixed at the prevailing price index leaving it to the workmen to ask for increase in minimum wage on any further rise in price index; (3 ) that the revised wages were payable with effect from 13th December, 1962; (4) that the three elements of basic wage, dearness allowance, and production bonus which make up the total minimum wage packet of Rs. 84 (Rs. 73 + Pa. 11) should be in the proportion of 3: 3: 1, and that profit bonus was payable at three months'basic wage.\nThe proportion of 3:3: 1 was fixed by the Tribunal, because, under an agreement of 1959 the management and workmen accepted that proportion by mutual consent.\nOn the basis of that agreement, the Tribunal also held that; (5) casual workers should not be equated to permanent workers for purpose of minimum wages, and that casual and radii workers should not be allowed bonus on the same basis as the permanent workers; (6) The appellants also claimed before the Tribunal 6 months'basic wage instead of 3 months'basic wage, which was being paid by the respondent, on the assumption that certain before staff were being paid as bonus 3 months'consolidated wage consisting of basic wage and de\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInput: Appeal No. 647 of 1966.\nAppeal by special leave from the judgment and decree dated June 19, 24, 1963 of the Gujarat High Court in Appeal No. 704 of 1960 from Appellate Decree.\nP.

BHATT Inspector General of Prisons, Government of Saurashtra.\n\" The plaintiff filed a written statement.\nHe was dismissed by the Inspector General of Prisons, Saurashtra on February 2/4, 1955, on the basis of the report of the Enquiry Officer.\nThe plaintiff applied to the Governor of Saurashtra for a copy of the report of the Enquiry Officer and the Governor denied the same.\nThe plaintiff applied to the High Court of Saurashtra for a copy of the report and the High Court held that the plaintiff was entitled to a copy of the report.\nThe High Court also held that the order of dismissal was illegal and void.\nThe High Court also held that the liability for the payment of the arrears of pay was that of the State of Maharashtra.\nNow, coming to the first point raised by the learned counsel for the State of Maharashtra, namely, that the High Court erred in holding that there had been a breach of article 311 (2) of the Constitution.\nAccording to the plaintiff, the High Court correctly held that the Inspector General of Prisons, Saurashtra, failed to supply the plaintiff with a copy of the report of the Enquiry Officer, which report was required to be supplied to the plaintiff under article 311(2) of the Constitution.\nArticle 311(2) of the Constitution provides that the appropriate Government shall, as soon as possible after the receipt of a complaint that a person employed under the Government has been subjected to torture, shall make an enquiry and the person concerned shall be given a copy of the report of the enquiry.\nThe High Court held that the Inspector General of Prisons, Saurashtra, failed to supply the plaintiff with a copy of the report of the Enquiry Officer, which was required to be supplied to the plaintiff under article 311(2) of the Constitution.\nIt is true that the Inspector General of Prisons, Saurashtra, failed to supply the plaintiff with a copy of the report of the Enquiry Officer.\nThe High Court correctly held that the failure to supply the copy of the report of the Enquiry Officer was a breach of article 311 (2) of the Constitution.\nThe High Court also held that the order of dismissal was illegal and void on the ground that the Inspector General of Prisons, Saurashtra, failed to supply the plaintiff with a copy of the report of the Enquiry Officer.\nThe High Court also held that the liability for the payment of the arrears of pay was that of the State of Maharashtra.\nNow, coming to the second point raised by the learned counsel for the State of Maharashtra, namely, that the High Court er\nActual: The first respondent while he was holding the post of a Senior Jailor in March, 1954, was suspended on the allegations that he had committed certain acts of misappropriation and maltreatment of prisoners.\nAfter January, 1955.\nA show cause notice was then issued to him to which he replied by a written statement.\nThe respondent was dismissed by an order of Inspector General of Prisons in February, 1955.\nThe respondent filed a suit for a declaration that enquiry report was never supplied to him and consequently he had not been given reasonable opportunity within the meaning of article 311 of the Constitution.\nHe also prayed for a decree for arrears of pay from April, 1954 to May, 1960.\nHis suit was dismissed by the trial court but he succeeded in the first appeal where the order of dismissal was declared illegal and void.\nAn appeal by the respondent to the High Court claiming arrears of salary was allowed.\nAs the State of Bombay had, in the meantime, been reorganised, the High Court also directed that the liability for arrears of salary upto the date of suit would be that of the State of Maharashtra and the liability arising out of the declaration that the appellant was in Government service would be the liability of the State of Gujarat.\nA Letters Patent appeal filed by the State of Maharashtra was dismissed.\nIn appeal to this Court, it was contended, inter alia, on behalf of the appellant that the liability to pay arrears of pay was not a liability arising out of a contract within the meaning of section 60 of the Bombay Reorganisation Act of 1960 but it was a liability in respect of an actionable wrong other than a breach of contract within the meaning of section 61 of the Act.\nHELD: (1) The High Court had rightly found that the failure on the part of the competent authority to provide the respondent with a copy of the report of the Enquiry Officer amounted to denial of reasonable opportunity contemplated by article 311(2) of the Constitution.\nThe Inspector General of Prisons had the report before him and the tentative conclusions arrived at by the Enquiry Officer were bound to influence him and in depriving the plaintiff of a copy of the report he was handicapped in not knowing what material was influencing the Inspector General of Prisons.\n[920 F] Union of India vs H.

They are all domiciles of the Telengana region.\nThey were appointed to posts which were reserved for the domicile of the Telengana region.\nThe Government of Andhra Pradesh passed the said rules.\nThe rules were not made under the authority of Parliament.\nThe rules were made under the authority of the State Government of Andhra Pradesh.\nThe rules were made in contravention of articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution.\nThe Government of Andhra Pradesh passed the order on January 21, 1969 relieving the non-domicile persons from their posts and providing them employment in the Andhra region without break in service.\nThe non-domicile persons who were relieved of their posts were given the option to accept the employment in the Andhra region on the terms and conditions laid down in the order.\nThe non-domicile persons were given the option to accept the employment in the Andhra region by creating supernumerary posts if necessary.\nThe non-domicile persons who accepted the employment were to be adjusted against future vacancies in the corresponding posts.\nThe non-domicile persons who did not accept the employment were to be relieved of their posts on March 31, 1969.\nThe non-domicile persons were given the option to accept the employment in the Andhra\nActual: The Parliament enacted the Public Employment (Requirement as to Residence) Act, 1957 in pursuance of cl.\n(3) of article 16 of the Constitution of India making special provision for requirement as to residence in public employment.\nSection 3 of the Act gave the power to make rules in respect of certain classes of employment in certain areas, and accord ingly the Andhra Pradesh Public Employment (Requirement as to Residence) Rules were made prescribing the requirement, as to residence prior to appointment to certain posts, within the Telengana area of the State.\nThe petitioners who were non domicile persons appointed to the posts reserved for the domiciles of Telengana under the rules, were by an order relieved from their posts and employed in the other'region of the State.\nThe petitioners, filed a petition under article 32 of the Constitution challenging the Act, the Rules and the order as ultra vires the Constitution.\nQuashing the order, this Court, HELD : Section 3 of the Public Employment (Requirement as to Residence) Act, 1957 in so far as it related to, Telengana and Rule 3 of other Rules under it were ultra vires the Constitution.\n[122 A] Clause (3) of article 16 of the Constitution enables Parliament to make a law in a special case prescribing any requirement as to residence within a State or Union Territory prior to appointment, in the State or Union Territory.\nThe provision speaks of a whole State as the venue for residential qualification and it is impossible to think that the Constituent Assembly was thinking of residence in Districts, Talukas, cities, towns or villages.\nThe fact that the clause is an exception and came as an amendment must dictate that a narrow construction upon the exception should be placed as indeed the debates in the Constituent Assembly also seem to, indicate.\nThe words 'any law'and 'any requirement'cannot be given wide and liberal construction.\nThese words are controlled by the words.\nresidence within the State or Union Territory'which words mean what they say neither more or less.\n[121 D G] 116\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInput: Appeal No. 1940 of 1967.\nAppeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated April 17, 27, 1967 of the Gujarat High Court in Civil Revision Application 328 of 1967.\nsection T.

cinematograph films in the said building.\nLater respondent No. 1 filed'suit No. 149 of 1960 to assert his right to exhibit films in the building.\nThe suit resulted in a compromise decree.\nIn pursuance of the compromise a further agreement dated December 1, 1960 was executed between the parties.\nHowever in 1963 respondent No. 1 again filed a suit claiming as a sub lessee or as lessee a right to exhibit films in the said building and praying that the defendants be restrained from interfering with that right.\nThe suit was filed under section 28 of the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act, 1947 in the Court of Small Causes.\nIn this suit respondent No. 1 asked the court to try additional issues Nos. 11, 12 and 13 as preliminary issues.\nIn issue No. 11 the question raised was whether the consent decree in the earlier suit operated as res judicata so that R & F could not question that the agreements between them and respondent No. 1 constituted a lease.\nIssue No. 12 raised the question whether in view of the consent decree R & F were estopped from leading evidence and asking questions in cross examination to show that the said agreements did not constitute a lease.\nIssue No. 13 raised the question whether section 92 of the Indian Evidence Act debarred R & F from leading evidence to the effect that the documents in question did not constitute a lease.\nThe Trial Court refused to try these as preliminary issues and its order was upheld by the High Court.\nAt the hearing of the case when the counsel for the defendants sought to ask a witness for respondent No. 1 whether the agreement dated November 27, 1954 was a commercial transaction and not a lease respondent No. 1 objected to the question.\nThe objection was disallowed by the trial court.\nIn revision under section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure the High Court did not interfere with the trial court's order in respect of issues Nos. 12 and 13.\nIn respect of issue No. 11, the High Court held that the agreement dated November 27, 1954 must in view of the consent decree in suit No. 149 of 1960 be held to be a lease,

M/s Amarchand Sobhachand 'a firm registered under the Indian Income tax Act, 1922, carried on business at Madras in drugs, chemicals, mercury, camphor and silk yam and as money lenders.\nThere were two partners of the firm Mohanlal Sagmal and Seshmal Sobhachand, and Ramniklal and Lakshmichand minors were admitted to the benefits of the partnership, each with 7/32 share in the profits.\nThe appellants had for a long time business relations with a firm styled \"Bhojaji Sobhachand\" carrying on business at Bombay as importers of yam and also as agents and adathias.\nSobhachand, one of the partners of Bhojaji Sobhachand with 16% share in the profit and loss is the father of Seshmal, Ramniklal and Lakshmichand, partners of the appellants.\nIn the books of account of the appellants which were main tained according to the mercantile, system there was a current sarafi account in respect of their transactions with the Bombay firm in which were credited the funds transmitted from Bombay in respect of their business transactions.\nEntries relating to interest were posted till the end of Samvat Year 2006 in the account on the amount due at the foot of the account.\nThe following is a table showing the balances at the end of the Samvat years 2003 Amount Interest At the end of the Samvat Year 2003 Cr.16,951 00 2004 Dr.1,02,188 4 5Dr.\n2633 9 3 2005 Cr.27,815 0 0Dr.\n483 1 9 2006 Cr.11,975 0 0Cr.\n1008 7 3 2007 Dr.2,02,823 12 3 2008 Dr.2,68,385 1 3 In the assessment for income tax of the appellants for the assessment year 1952 53 relevant to the account year Samvat 417 2007 all item of Rs. 2,03,147 8 O in the, account of the, Bombay was disallowed by the Income tax Officer, but in appeal the amount was allowed.\nin the return of income for the assessment year 1953 54 the appellants claimed allowance for Rs. 2,68,385/ due from the Bombay firm at the foot of their running account as a bad debt written off as irrecoverable.\nThe Income tax Officer disallowed their claim holding that : \"these transactions were mere accommodations which can have no bearing to the regular business carried on by the assessee.\n\" The Appellate Assistant Commissioner agreed with the Income tax Officer.\nHe held that the debt.\ndid not arise, in the course of the appellants'business as chemists and druggists nor in the course of their money lending business.\nThe Income tax Appellate Tribunal accordingly confirmed the order of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner.\nThe assessee firm then applied to the Tribunal to refer the following question to the High Court of Madras \"Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the disallowance of the bad debt of Rs. 2,68,385 is right in law?\" The Tribunal rejected the application, but pursuant to an order made by the High Court of, Madras under section 66(2) submitted a statement of the case on the following question \"Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was right in law in holding that the debt of Rs. 2,68,385/ was not one incurred in the course of money lending business of the assessee?\" In the opinion of the High Court the debt of Rs. 2,68,385/ due to the appellants was not a bad and doubtful debt in its money lending business not a debt representing loss sustained in the other business.\nThe question referred was, therefore, answered in the affirmative and against the appellants.\nSection 10(2) (xi) of the Indian Income tax Act, 1922, as in force during the relevant accounting year, reads as follows :\n\"Where any amount of money or property for or to the payment of which the assessee is liable and such liability is not covered by any provision of this Act, the amount or property shall be considered as income of the assessee and shall be included in the total income of the assessee under section 14 of this Act.\" This section was interpreted by the Tribunal as follows :\n\"This section applies to all amounts due to the assessee by virtue of the mercantile system of accounting. Where an assessee receives money or property from a customer and it is not possible to determine the amount of the debt or the extent of the liability of the customer, the Tribunal will take into account the fact that the amount is due to the assessee by virtue of the mercantile system of accounting and the fact that the amount is due to the assessee by virtue of the mercantile system of accounting and the fact that the amount is due to the assessee by virtue of the mercantile system of accounting and the fact that the amount is due to the assessee by virtue of the mercantile system of accounting and the fact that the amount is due to the assessee by virtue of the mercantile system of accounting and the fact that the amount is due to the assessee by virtue of the mercantile system of accounting and the fact that the amount is due to the assessee by virtue of the mercantile system of accounting and the fact that the amount is due to the assessee by virtue of the mercantile system of accounting and the fact that the amount is due to the assessee by virtue of the mercantile system of accounting and the fact that the amount is due to the assessee by virtue of the mercantile system of accounting and the fact that the amount is due to the assessee by virtue of the mercantile system of accounting and the fact that the amount is due to the assessee by virtue of the mercantile system of accounting and the fact that the amount is due to the assessee by virtue of the mercantile system of accounting and the fact that the amount is due to the assessee by virtue of the mercantile system of accounting and the fact that the amount is due to the assessee by virtue of the mercantile system of accounting and the fact that the amount is due to the assessee by virtue of the mercantile system of accounting and the fact that the amount is due to the assessee by\nActual: The appellants we're a registered partnership firm engaged in money lending business as well as business in certain chemical goods, and silk yarn.\nAnother firm had a current account with the appellants between the samvat years 2003 and 2008.\nAt the end of the latter year the said account had a debit balance of Rs. 268385 1 3.\nIn the return of income for the assessment year 1953 54 the appellants claimed allowance for the said sum of Rs. 268385 as a bad debt written off as irrecoverable.\nThe claim was disallowed by the authorities under the Income tax Act, 1922.\nThe Tribunal referred to the High Court under section 66(2) of the Income tax Act, 192Z the question whether on the facts and circumstances of the case the Tribunal's finding that the sum in question did not relate to the appellants money lending business was correct.\nThe High Court answered the question in the affirmative against the appellants.\nThis Court in appeal by special leave re framed the question to be answered by the Tribunal so as to cover not only the money lending business of the appellants but also the business in chemicals etc.\nThe Court directed the Tribunal to submit a supplementary statement of case.\nThe supplementary statement of case submitted by the Tribunal was however found unsatisfactory in as much as it contained a summary of arguments on both sides but no findings on the,facts of the case.\nHence supplementary statement on 'facts was called for.\nThe findings given by the Tribunal were against the appellants.\nOn the contention that the conclusion reached by the Tribunal was not supported by proper discussion of the materials before it, HELD : The findings reached by the Tribunal were findings of fact and those findings were supported by the evidence on record.\nThe Tribunal had found that the loans were not made in the course of money lending business of the assessee nor in respect of any other business of the assessee.\nThis finding covered the entire amount sought to be deducted.\nIn view of this finding which was binding on this Court, the answer to the question re framed had to be in favour of the department.\n[423 B] Also held : (i) The Tribunal in submitting its statement,of case must give not only the facts of the case or the arguments of parties but also its own findings on the, facts and evidence.\n[410 D] (ii) When the assessee had money lending as well as other business, its claim for a bad debt under section \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInput: l Misc.\nPetitions Nos.\n401/and 4012 of 1968.\nApplications by respondent No. 1 for revocation of the certificate granted by the Madras High Court on 15th October, 1968 under article 133(1)(a) & (b) of the Constitution of India.\nAND Civil Appeals Nos. 2183 and 2184 of 1968.\nAppeals from the judgment and order elated October 9, 1968 of the Madras High Court in O.S.A.

(2)....... (3)No reference made by the Central Government under sub section, (1), at any time before the first day of September, 1948, shall be valid unless the case or points in a case thus referred for investigation, shall be deemed to be within the purview of the provisions of this Act.\n(4) Any case or points in a case which is referred to the Commission under sub section (1), shall be deemed to be within the purview of the provisions of this Act, if it is found that such case or points in a case, relates to any of the matters mentioned in clause (a) of section 3.\nSection 6.

The Commission shall, on the receipt of any material from any person, make such inquiry as it may deem fit to make, and may require the person to furnish any further material which it may deem fit to require.\nSection 7. The Commission shall, after making such inquiry as it may deem fit to make\nActual: Sub section (4) of section 5 of the Taxation on Income (Investigation Commission) Act, 1947, does not deal with the same class of persons as are said to have been grouped together in subsection (1) of section 5 of the Act as persons who to a substantial extent evaded payment of taxation on income.\nOn a plain reading of the section it is clear that sub section (4) of section 5 is not limited only to persons who made extraordinary profits and to all persons who may have evaded payment of taxation on income irrespective of whether the evaded profits are substantial or insubstantial and therefore the scope of sub section (4) of section 5 is different from the scope of sub section (1) of section 5 both in extent and range.\nSub section (4) of section 5 of the Act, obviously deals with the same class of persons who fall within the ambit of section 34 of the Indian Income tax Act and are dealt with in sub section (1) of that section and whose income can be caught by the proceeding under that section.\nIt is not possible to hold that all such persons who evaded payment of income tax and do not truly disclose all particulars or material facts necessary for their assessment and against whom a, report is made under sub section (4) of section 5 of the impugned 449 Act by themselves form a class distinct from those who evade payment of income tax and come within the ambit of section 34 of the Indian Income tax Act.\nBoth section 34 of the Indian Income tax Act, 1.922, and subsection (4) of section 5 of the Taxation on Income (Investigation Commission) Act, 1947, deal with all persons who have similar characteristics and similar properties, the common characteristics being that they are persons who have not truly disclosed their income and have evaded payment of taxation on income.\nThe procedure prescribed by the Taxation on Income (Investigation Commission) Act, 1947, is substantially more prejudicial and more drastic to the assessee than the procedure under the Indian Income tax Act (XI of 1922).\nHeld, therefore that sub section (4) of section 5 and the procedure prescribed by the impugned Act in so far as it affects the persons proceeded against under that sub section being a piece of discriminatory legislation offends against the provisions of article 14 of the Constitution and is thus void and unenforceable.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInput: Appeal No. 1671 of 1966.\nAppeal from the judgment and decree dated March 31, 1965 of the Madras High Court in Appeal No. 276 of 1962.\nM.K.

No. 3 of 1961 in the Court of Subordinate Judge, Nagapattinam for setting aside the order dated May 10, 1960 of respondent No. 1 the Commissioner of Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments, Madras who had affirmed earlier the order of the second respondent, the Deputy Commissioner, holding that the trusteeship of the Kumaran Koil in Manjakollai village was not hereditary.\nThe appellant was elected as a trustee by the Sengunatha Mudaliars of Manjakollai village at a meeting held on June 27, 1957.\nAccording to the appellant the temple was rounded two hundred years ago by the members of his community and since then the management of the temple and is affairs was always vested in the community of the Sengunatha Mudaliars and no person other than the elected trustee had at any time the right of management and control of the temple.\nThe appellant said that the temple was declared as an \"exempted\" temple under the provisions of Madras Act 1 of 1925.\nThe case of the appellant was that the trusteeship of the temple was \"hereditary\".\nThe respondents, however, took a different view and proceeded on the basis that trusteeship of the Kumaran Koil was not hereditary.\nThe Subordinate Judge held that the appellant was a hereditary trustee and the suit was not barred by limitation.\nThe respondents took the matter in appeal to the Madras High Court which by its judgment dated March 31, 1965 allowed the appeal and set aside the judgment of the Subordinate Judge Nagapattinam.\nSection 6, sub section\n(9) of Madras Act 19 of 1951 states: \"In this Act, unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context (9) 'hereditary trustee'means the trustee of a religious institution succession to whose office devolves by hereditary right or is regulated by usage or is specifically provided for by the founder, so long as such scheme of succession is in force;\" This Act has been substituted by Madras Act 22 of 1959 but the definition of the trustee is identical in both the Acts.\nThe question to be considered in this appeal is whether the appellant is a hereditary trustee Within the meaning of the section.\nThe definition includes three types of cases: (1) succession to the office of trusteeship devolving by hereditary right; (2) succession 426 to such office being regulated by usage; and (3) succession being specifically provided for by the founder on condition that the scheme of such succession is still in force.\nIt is not the case of the appellant that the trustees of the temple of the Kumaran Koil are hereditary trustees because their office'devolves by hereditary right or because succession to that office is specifically provided for by the founder.\nThe contention on behalf of the appellant is that the succession is \"regulated by usage\".\nIt was said that according to the usage of the temple the trustees were elected for a period of one year each at a meeting of the members of the Sangunatha Mudaliar Community and so the appellant must be held to be a trustee within the meaning of section 6(9) of Act 19 of 1951.\nIn our opinion, there is no warrant for this argument.\nThe phrase \"regulated by usage\" in section 6(9) of the Act must be construed along with the phrase \"succession to this office\" and when so construed that part of the definition would only apply where the ordinary rules of succession under the Hindu law are modified by usage and succession has to be determined in accordance with the modified rules.\nThe word \"succession\" in relation to property and rights and interests in property generally implies \"passing of an interest from one person to another\" (vide in Re: Hindu Women's Right to Property Act, 1941 (1).\nIt is now well established that the office of a hereditary trustee is in the nature of property.\nThis is so whether the trustee has a beneficial interest of some sort or not (see Ganesh Chunder Dhur vs Lal Behary(2) and Bhabatarini vs Ashalata(3).\nOrdinarily a shebaitship or a hereditary trusteeship is a heritable office.\nThe office of a shebait or a hereditary trustee is not one of those offices which are regulated by \"usage\".\nTherefore, the contention of the appellant that the succession to the office of the trustee of the Kumaran Koil was \"regulated by usage\" is not tenable.\nThe Subordinate Judge was therefore right in holding that the trust is hereditary in nature.\nIn our opinion, the judgment of the High Court is not in accordance with law and the same is liable to be reversed.\nThe appeal is allowed.\n(1) 39 Ind.

Rangam for the Respondents\nActual: The appellant was elected as a trustee of a temple for one year.\nThe temple was rounded two hundred years ago by the members of the community and according to the usage of the temple, the trustees were elected for one year, at a meeting of the members of the community.\nOn the question whether the appellant has a hereditary trustee, because he was, under section 6(9) of the Madras Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Act, 1951, the 'trustee of a religious institution succession to whose office is regulated by usage ', HELD: The phrase'succession to whose office is regulated by usage'would only apply when the ordinary rules of succession under the Hindu law are modified by usage, and succession has to be determined in accordance with the modified rules.\nThe office of a hereditary trustee is in the nature of property.\nSuccession in relation to property implies passing of an interest from one person to another.\n[428 C D] In the present case, the election to the office was for a fixed period of one year.\nIn such a case, it is not possible to say there is a succession to the office, because: (a) on the efflux of the period for which one trustee is appointed, there is a vacancy and another is elected to that vacancy, and (b) since there is a possibility of the same trustee being reelected, an impossible legal position arises in which a person could be a successor of himself.\n[429 F H] In re Hindu Women's Right to Property Act, 1941, Ganesh Chunder Dhur vs Lal Behary, 63 I.A. 448, Bhabatarini vs Ashalata, 70 I.A. 57, Angurbala Mullick vs Debabrata Mullick, 1134 and Sital Das vs Sant Ram, A.I.R. 1954 S.C. 606 applied.\nShri Mahant Paramananda Das Goswwami vs Radhakrishna Das., referred to.\nState of Madras vs Ramakrishna, I.L.R., approved.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInput: N: Criminal Appeal No. 87 of 1967.\n721 Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated January 24, 1967 of the High Court of Mysore in Criminal Appeal.No.\n29 of 1965.\nA. section R.

Chari is that the presumption that they were dacoits ought not to have been drawn since the circumstances do not admit the drawing of such a presumption in the case, According to Mr. Chari, the presumption to be drawn ought to have been one under section 41 1 722 of Indian Penal Code or at the most tinder section 412 of the Indian Penal Code but not of complicity in the crime of dacoity.\nHe contends that the circumstances under which the one presumption or the other may be drawn under section 114 of the have not been stated by law and therefore it is necessary always to start with the lesser presumption and draw the higher presumption only when there is some other evidence to show the complicity of the persons in the crime itself.\nAccording to him there is no other evidence in the case which points, to the complicity of the 14 appellants in the crime of dacoity and therefore as they cannot be suspected to be dacoits themselves, the only presumption to be drawn is one of receivers of stolen property or as receivers of property which was stolen in a dacoity.\nIn our opinion, the law advocated by Mr. Chari is not correct.\nIf there is other evidence, to connect an accused with the crime itself, however small, the finding of the stolen property with him is a piece of evidence which connects him further with the crime.\nThere is then no question of presumption.\nThe evidence strengthens the other evidence already against him.\nIt is only when the accused cannot be connected with the crime except by reason of possession of the fruits of crime that the presumption may be drawn.\nIn what circumstances the one presumption or the other may be drawn, it is not necessary to state categorically in this case.\nIt all depends upon the circumstances under which the discovery of the fruits of crime are made with a particular accused.\nIt has been stated on more than one occasion that if the gap of time is, too large, the presumption that the accused was concerned with the crime itself gets weakened.\nThe presumption is stronger when the discovery of the fruits of crime is made immediately after the crime is.\ncommitted.\nThe reason is obvious.\nDisposal of the fruits of crime requires the finding of a person ready to receive them and the shortness of time, the nature of the property which is disposed of, that is to say, its perishable nature, are all the circumstances which would strengthen the case against the accused.\nIn the present case, it is alleged that the accused persons were found with the stolen cloth immediately after the crime.\nThat is to say, only three days after the crime.\nTherefore, the presumption is strong that the accused persons were concerned with the crime itself.\nWe are, therefore, of the opinion that the High Court was justified in drawing the conclusion that the accused persons were themselves the dacoits and in convicting them under section 395 of the Indian Penal Code.\nThe result is that the appeal is rejected. There shall be no order as to costs.  1. Appeal from the judgment and order dated January 24, 1967 of the High Court of Mysore in Criminal Appeal No. 29 of 1965.\n2. The judgment of the Court was delivered by Hidayatullah, C.J.\n3. These are 14 appellants who appeal against their conviction under section 395 of the Indian Penal Code and sentences of 5 years rigorous imprisonment and fine of Rs. 1,000/- passed on them.\n4. Originally 20 persons were tried and convicted for the same offence and received a like sentence.\n5. 14 alone have appealed to this Court.\n6. The incident which took place on July 28, 1962 was theft by dacoity of certain cotton pieces from two carts within the limits of Lingsugar Police Station at about 11:30 p.m.\n7. The facts are that two traders in cloth sent their wares in carts for sale.\n8. The cartmen halted after the market was over on the way for food.\n9. Thereafter six carts left for Mudgal at about 10 p.m.\n10. When the carts reached a Nala called Heri Halla about three miles from Lingsugur at about 11:30 p.m., 20 persons are said to have approached the carts and pelted stones.\n11. It was a dark night and the assailants were not identified.\n12. It appears that four out of the six carts escaped, but two carts were looted.\n13. The police investigated the case and arrested the 20 persons who were accused in the case as being the culprits involved in this incident.\n14. It is not necessary to go into rest of the case or the evidence on which the case of dacoity was established, because dacoity as such is not challenged before us\nActual: Two carts loaded with cloth returning alongwith others from a weekly village market were looted by 20 or more persons.\nThe houses of 20 persons including the 14 appellants were searched and the looted cloth was recovered from their Possession.\nThey were tried and held guilty Linder section 395 of the Indian Penal Code.\nThe High Court dismissed their appeals.\nIn appeal by special leave to this Court their only contention was that in the absence of other evidence connecting them with the dacoity, the presumption to be drawn from the possession of stolen clothes ought to have been one under section 411 of he Indian Penal Code or at the most under section 412 of the Indian Penal Code and not of complicity in the crime of dacoity.\nIt was urged that since section 114 of the Evidence Act did not lay down definitely the presumption to be drawn in a given set of circumstances it was necessary always to start with the lesser presumption and draw the higher presumption only when there was some other evidence to.\nshow the complicity of the persons in the crime itself.\nHELD : If there is other evidence to connect an accused with the crime itself, however small, the finding of the stolen property with him is a piece of evidence which connects him further with the crime.\nThere is then no question of presumption.\nThe evidence strengthens the other evidence already against him.\nIt is only when the accused cannot be conis stronger than if there is a large gap of time.\nDisposal of the fruits of crime that the presumption may be drawn.\nIn what circumstances the one presumption or the other may be drawn will differ from case to case [722 D] When the discovery of the fruits of crime is made immediately after the commission of the crime the presumption of complicity in the crime nected with the crime except by reason of possession of the fruits of crime requires the finding of a person ready to receive them and the'shortness of time, the nature of the property which is disposed of, that is to say, its quality and character determine whether the person who had the goods in his possession received them from another or was himself the thief or dacoit, [722 F] In the present case the offence was committed at night by as many as 'IO persons or more.\nShortly after the offence the houses of 20 persons were searched and large quantities of the stolen goods were found in their houses.\nIt was impossible that these 20 persons were merely'receivers of stolen property from some other 20 persons who were the decoits.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInput: Appeal No. 1311 of 1967.\nAppeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated January 17, 1967 of the Patna High Court in C.W.J.C.

of the Act reads \"No notice shall be issued under Section 148 after the expiry of four years from the end of the relevant assessment year, unless the Commissioner is satisfied on the reasons recorded

Rao under r. 14 of the Army Rules, 1954.\nThe facts leading to his removal are as follows : Rao was a commissioned officer in the Indian Army and was attached to the Army Ordnance Corps Training Centre, Secundrabad.\nIt was alleged that on April 4, 1958, he committed acts of.gross misconduct.\nThe allegations were as follows : \"Knowing Kumari Prakash as the daughter of a brother Officer, Rao assisted her in going away from her parents protection and planning to run away with a sepoy. \" \"Rao, by threatening to cause harm to Kumari Prakash's parents, intimidated her t o visit his house where he took her in his scooter to the unit lines of 51 1 1 Gurkha Rifles where he arranged her meeting with a sepoy of the unit.\" \"He (i.e. Rao) acquiesced in the girl being met by the sepoy later at a tea shop nearby where she received a present of a sari and blouse from the sepoy in his presence.\" \"Rao thus actively abetted in the attempt of brother officer's daughter elope with a sepoy.\" \"Rao then took Kumari Prakash to a hotel \"Saidya Lodge'in Hyderabad and got a room to themselves by impersonating and giving a false identity as \"Mr. & Mrs. Prakash\".\nAn inquiry into the matter was made by Court of Inquiry.\nThe Chief of the Army Staff, after going through the proceedings of the Court of Inquiry, considered that the conduct of Capt.\nRao was most unbecoming of an officer.\nAs he was of opinion that trial of the officer by a General Court Martial was inexpedient, he ordered administrative action to be taken under r. 14 of the Army Rules, 1954.\nBy memorandum dated September 4, 1958, Rao was called upon to submit his explanation by way of defence regarding the allegations against him.\nThe explanation of Rao was placed before the Central Government.\nThe Central Government found it to be unsatisfactory, and on April 9, 1959, an order was passed removing the respondent from service.\nRao thereupon filed a petition under article 226 of the Constitution for quashing the order of removal from service on the 449 ground, inter alia, that r. 14 of the Army Rules, 1954, was ultra vires the, and that the action taken thereunder was without any authority.\nIn the petition Rao gave a somewhat different version of what had happened.\nAccording to him he did not assist Kumari Prakash to go away from her parents'house.\nAt the hearing of the petition the only point which was urged was the validity of r. 14 of the Army Rules, 1954.\nIf this rule was intra vires the, Rao has no case.\nThe Army Rules, 1954, including r. 14, were framed in exer cise of the powers conferred by section 191 of the.\nRule 14 of the Army Rules, 1954, is as follows: \"(1) When after considering the reports on an officer's misconduct, the Central Gove rnment is satisfied or the C in C is of the opinion, that the trial of the officer by a court martial is inexpedient or impracticable but considers the further retention of the said officer in the service as undesirable, the C in C shall communicate the view of the Central Government or his views, as the case may be, to the officer together with all reports adverse to him and he shall be called upon to submit his explanation and defence.\n(2) In the event of the explanation of the officer being considered unsatisfactory by the \"C in C, or when so directed by the Central Government, the case shall be submitted to the Central Government with the officer's defence and the recommendation of the C in C as to whether the officer should be, (a) dismissed from the service; or (b) removed from the service; or (c) be given the option to retire on full pay or (d) be given the option to retire on half pay for the remainder of his service.\n(3) If the Central Government is of opinion that the officer should be removed from the service, the C in C shall communicate his view to the officer and direct that he shall be removed from the service forthwith.\n(4) The removal shall be made by an order in writing addressed to the officer, specifying the date on which he shall cease to hold the position of the officer, the date on which he shall cease to hold the position of the officer and his rank and service shall cease to be that of an officer, and he shall be liable to be punished in accordance with the Army Regulations.\n(5) The order of removal shall be communicated to the officer personally or by registered post or by messenger in the event of the officer being out of India.\n(6) Where the order of removal is communicated to the officer personally, the officer shall, on being informed of the order, be given a reasonable time to make arrangements for the disposal of his effects and shall be paid the amount of the last drawn salary, and on the expiry of the said reasonable time, he shall cease to hold any position in the service.\n(7) Where the order of removal is communicated to the officer by registered post or by messenger, the officer shall, on receipt of the order, be given a reasonable time to make arrangements for the disposal of his effects and shall be paid the amount of the last drawn salary, and on the expiry of the said reasonable time, he shall cease to hold any position in the service.\"\nIn this case, the Central Government had, by a letter dated September 4, 1958, called upon Rao to submit his explanation by way of defence. The explanation given by Rao was considered to be unsatisfactory.\nOn the other hand, r. 16 of the Army Rules, 1954, provides that if the explanation of an officer is considered unsatisfactory, the case shall be submitted to the Central Government with the officer's defence and the recommendation of the C in C as to whether the officer should be dismissed from the service, removed from the service, or given the option to retire on full pay or on half pay.\nIt is clear that r. 14 of the Army Rules, 1954, is not intra vires the, as it is not framed in exercise of the power conferred by section 191 of the Constitution.\nSection 191\nActual: The respondent, a commissioned officer in the Indian Army, was found to have committed acts of gross misconduct by a Court of Inquiry.\nThe Chief of the Army Staff was of the opinion that his trial by a General Court Martial was inexpedient, and the respondent was removed from service after following the procedure under r. 14 of the Army Rules, 1954.\nOn the question whether r. 14, which gives power to the Central Government to remove an officer without being tried and convicted by Court Martial was in derogation of section 45,, which specifically provides for conviction by court martial and punishment for unbecoming conduct, HELD : The rule is not ultra vires.\n[451 D] (1) Section 19 of the Act provides that subject to the provisions of the Act and the rules made thereunder the Central Government may remove from service, any person subject to the Act.\nTherefore, the section itself suggests that there should be rules regarding removal from service, and section 191 (2) (a) of the Act specifically gives power to make a rule providing for the removal from the service of persons subject to the Act.\n[450 H; 451 A B] (2) Although section 19 uses the words \"subject to the provisions of this Act\", the section is not subject to section 45.\nThe power under section 19 is independent of the power under section 45, because, while section 19 speaks of removal of a person, section 45 provides that on conviction by Court Martial an officer is liable to be cashiered or to suffer such less punishment as is in the Act mentioned.\n[451 B D]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInput: iminal Appeal No. 48 of 1954.\n1303 Appeal by Special Leave granted by the Supreme Court by its Order dated the 31st July 1953 from the Judgment and Order dated the 15th May 1953 of the High Court of Judicature for the State of Pepsu at Th, Patiala in Criminal Appeal No. 140 of 1952 arising out of the Judgment and Order dated the 31st March 1952 of the Court of Magistrate 1st Class, Patiala in Challan Case No. 160/102 of 1951.\nJai Gopal Sethi, (Naunit Lal, with him) for the appellant.\nN. section Bindra, (Porus A.

Mehta and P. G. Gokhale, with him) for the respondent.\nFebruary 28.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by VENKATARAMA AYYAR J.\nThe appellant was a Sub Divisional Officer in the Public Works Department, Pepsu, and was, at the material dates,, in charge of certain works at a place called Karhali.\nIt was part of his duties to disburse the wages to the workmen employed in the works, and the procedure usually followed was that be drew the amount required from the treasury, and paid the same to the emplo yees against their signatures or thumb impressions in the monthly acquittance roll.\nIn the roll for April 1951, one Parma was mentioned as a khalasi (menial servant), and a sum of Rs. 51 shown as paid to him for his wages, the payment being vouched by thumbimpression.\nThe case of the prosecution was that there was, in fact, no person of the name of Parma, that the thumb impression found in the acquittance roll was that of the appellant himself, that he had included a fictitious name in the acquittance roll, with intent to himself draw the amount, and that by this expedient he had received Rs. 51 and misappropriated the same.\nThe First Class Magistrate of Patiala, before whom the appellant was put up for trial, framed charges against him under section 465 of the Indian Penal Code for forging the thumb impression of Parma, and under section 409 of the Indian Penal Code for criminal misappropriation of Rs. 51, and after a full trial, 167 1304 acquitted him.\nHe held on the evidence that \"there was a khalasi Parma by name in the service of the accused at Kehrauli\", and that though the thumbimpression in the acquittance roll was that of the appellant, the prosecution had not established that the amount drawn by him did not reach the hands of Parma.\nAgainst this judgment, there was an appeal by the State to the High Court of Pepsu, which held that proof that the thumb impression in the acquittance roll was that of the appellant was sufficient,,.when taken along with other circumstances, to establish his guilt, and accordingly convicted him both under section 465 and section 409 of the Indian Penal Code.\nThis appeal by special leave is directed against this judgment.\nIn support of \" the appeal it is argued by Mr. Jai Gopal Sethi that the conviction of the appellant is illegal, as sanction had not been obtained under section 197 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure for his prosecution, that the evidence on record is insufficient to establish an offence either under section 465 or section 409 of the Indian Penal Code and that there having been an acquittal of the appellant by the trial Magistrate, the materials on record did not justify a reversal of that verdict by the appellate Court.\nThe question of sanction under section 197 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure may be taken up first for consideration, as it goes to the root of the matter.\nThe facts bearing on this question are that there was an application by the Department for sanction to prosecute the appellant for an offence under section 409, and that, the Chief Secretary, Home Department, sent the communication, Exhibft PX, stating that he had been \"directed to convey sanction of the Government to his prosecution\".\nIn view of this, no question was raised before the trial Magistrate or the High Court that the prosecution was bad for want of sanction.\nBut after the disposal of the appeal by the High Court, it was discovered that, in fact, there was no order of the Government sanctioning the prosecution, and that the Chief Secretary had committed a mistake in sendidg the communication, Exhibit PX.\n1305 The position, therefore, is that the prosecution which has resulted in the conviction of the appellant was initiated without any sanction under section 197(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure and if sanction under that section is necessary, as contended for by Mr. Sethi, then the entire proceedings including the conviction must be quashed.\nAccording to the respondent, however, the main charge against the appellant is not under section 409, but under section 465 of the Indian Penal Code, and that section 409 requires sanction under section 197(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure and section 465 does not.\nIn this view, the respondent contends that the sanction under section 197(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure for prosecuting the appellant under section 409 has already been granted, and that, therefore, the subsequent discovery of the mistake in the communication by the Chief Secretary does not affect the validity of the conviction.\nThe question, therefore, resolves itself into whether section 409 of the Indian Penal Code requires sanction under section 197(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure or not.\nSection 197(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that no person shall be prosecuted or punished for an offence which is triable by a Magistrate unless the Government has given its sanction to the initiation of the prosecution.\nSection 409 of the Indian Penal Code defines criminal misappropriation and provides that whoever, being legally bound to pay or deliver any money to, or to the credit of any person, misappropriates such money, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years, or with fine which may extend to ten thousand rupees, or with both.\nNow, the offence of misappropriation of money by a public servant is triable by a Magistrate under section 24 of the Criminal Procedure Code.\nThe question, therefore, is whether the sanction required under section 197(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure for an offence under section 409 of the Indian Penal Code has to be given by the Government for the initiation of the prosecution of a public servant for misappropriation of money, or if the same is not required.\nThe answer to this question is not in dispute, and it is settled by the decisions of several High Courts that the sanction under section 197(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure is not required for an offence under section 409 of the Indian Penal Code for misappropriation of money by a public servant.\nThe only exception to this principle is where the public servant is charged with an offence under section 409 of the Indian Penal Code for misappropriation of a sum exceeding a certain amount, namely, Rs. 25,000.\nIn such cases, the sanction under section 197(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure is required.\nIn the present case, the amount misappropriated is only Rs. 51 and,\nActual: It is not every offence committed by a public servant that requires sanction for prosecution under section 197 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure nor even every act done by him while he is actually engaged in the performance of his official duties; but if the act complained of is directly concerned with his official duties so that, if questioned, it could be claimed to have been done by virtue of the office, then sanction would be necessary; and that would be so, irrespective of whether it was, in fact, a proper discharge of his duties, because that would really be a matter of defence on the merits, which would have to be investigated at the trial, and could not arise at the stage of the grant of sanction, which must precede the institution of the prosecution.\nWhether sanction is necessary to prosecute a public servant on a charge of criminal misappropriation, will depend on whether the acts complained of hinge on his duties as a public servant.\nIf they do, then sanction is requisite.\nBut if they are unconnected with such duties, then no sanction is necessary.\nHori Ram Singh vs Emperor ([1939] F.C.R. 159), H.

(1970) A.P. 70.\nIt arises out of a complaint filed against the 1st respondent company and its directors for failure to Me with the Registrar of Companies on or before 30 10 1967 the balance sheet and profit and loss account of the company as required under section 220(1) of the, which is punishable under sub section (3) of that section.\nAdmittedly no general body meeting had been held and, therefore, the balance sheet and profit and loss account had not been laid before a general body meeting nor could it be so laid.\nThe Full Bench speaking through Jaganmohan Reddy, C.J., as our learned brother then was, held that if no balance sheet is laid before a general body, there can be no question of that balance sheet not being adopted nor of complying with the requirements of section 220 and though wilful omission to call a general body meeting and to lay the balance sheet and profit and loss account before it may expose the person responsible to punishment under other provisions of the Act, it certainly does not make him liable under the provisions of section 134(4) of the Companies Act, 1913 or section 220 of the.\nIn this the Bench was taking a view contrary to that of most of the High Courts after the decision of this Court in The State of Bombay vs Bandhan Ram Bhandani & Ors.(1) In that case this Court (1) ;, 412 had taken the.\nview that a person charged with an offence cannot rely on his default as an answer to the charge and so, if he was responsible for not calling the general meeting, he cannot be heard to say in defence to the charges brought against him that because the general meeting had not been called, the balance sheet and profit and loss account could not be laid before it.\nIn that case the directors of a company were prosecuted under sections 32(5) and 133(3) of the Companies Act, 1913, for breaches of sections 32 and 131 of that Act for having knowingly and wilfully authorized the failure to file the summary of share capital for the year 1953 and being knowingly and wilfully parties to the failure to lay before the company in general meeting the balance sheet and profit and loss account as at March 31, 1953.\nThe Bombay High Court, however, following its earlier decision in Imperator vs The Pioneer Clay and Industrial Works Ltd.(1) had upheld the acquittal of the directors by the Presidency Magistrate.\nReferring to the decision of the Bombay High Court in that case this Court pointed out that decision turned on section 134 of the Companies Act, 1913 the language of which was to a certain extent different from the language used in sections 32 and 131 and refrained from going into the question whether the difference in language in section 134 on the one hand and sections 32 and 131 on the other made any difference to the decision of the case.\nAfter referring to the decisions in Gibson vs Barlon(2) Edmonds vs Foster(3) and Park vs Lawton(4 )where it was held that a person charged with an offence could not rely on his own default as an answer to the charge, and so, if the person charged was responsible for not calling the general meeting, he cannot be heard to say, in defence to the charge that the general meeting had not been called, and that the company and its officers were bound to perform the condition precedent if they could do that, in order that they might perform their duty, this Court considered that as the correct view to take.\nAs we have noticed, this Court was not dealing there with the provisions of section 134 of 1913 Act which corresponds to section 220 of the 1956 Act.\nThat question now directly arises for decision in this case.\nAs we said earlier, most of the High Courts which have considered this question after the decision of this Court have proceeded on the basis that the decision necessarily led to the conclusion that even in a prosecution under section 134 of the 1913 Act (corresponding to section 220 of the 1956 Act) the company and its directors could not rely upon their own default as an answer to the charge and that the company and its officers were bound to perform the condition precedent if they could do that, in order that they might perform their duty.\nWe, however, cannot agree with that view.\nThe language used in section 220(1) of the 1956 Act is that of a mandatory provision and in that view of the matter we cannot help but hold that if the company and its directors had failed to call a general meeting and therefore failed to lay before it the balance sheet and profit and loss account, then they were not in compliance with the mandatory provisions of the Act and, therefore, they were liable under section 220(4) of the Act.\nThe fact that the general meeting had not been called did not render the company and its directors excused from the performance of the mandatory provisions of the Act and so, the question of their liability under section 220(4) of the Act becomes relevant.\nIn our view, therefore, the decision of the Full Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in this case is correct and it does not call for any interference from this Court.\nIn view of the above discussions, the Appeal is dismissed.\nThe question whether a company and its directors can rely upon their own default as an answer to the charge of non-compliance with the provisions of section 220(1) of the Companies Act, 1956 is a question that has been considered by this Court in the case of The State of Bombay vs Bandhan Ram Bhandani & Ors. (1) in the light of section 220(3) of the said Act.\nIt was held there that a person charged with an offence cannot rely on his default as an answer to the charge and so, if the directors were responsible for not calling the general meeting, they cannot be heard to say in defence to the charges brought against them that because the general meeting had not been called, the balance sheet and profit and loss account could not be laid before it.\nBut the decision in that case turned on the language used in sections 32 and 131 of the Companies Act, 1913, which correspond to sections 32(5) and 133(3) of the Companies Act, 1956, and not on the language used in section 220(1) of the 1956 Act.\nIn this case, however, the issue is squarely one of the interpretation of section 220(1) of the Companies Act, 1956.\nThe Full Bench of the\nActual: Section 220 of the, which corresponds to section 134 of the 1913 Act, provides that within thirty days after the balance sheet and profit and loss account, as the case may be, have been laid before the company at the general meeting.\nthree copies thereof shall be filed with the registrar and that failure to do so is punishable.\nThe respondent company and its directors were prosecuted for failure to file with the Registrar of Companies on or before 30th October 1967, the Balance sheet and profit and loss account of the company.\nBy 30th September, 1967, admittedly, no general body meeting had been held.\nThe High Court held that since no general body meeting was held, there could be no question of laying the balance sheet before the general body meeting and complying with the requirements of the section; and that, though the willful omission to call a general body meeting and of laying the balance sheet and profit and loss account before it may expose the persons responsible to punishment under other provisions of the Act, it would not make them liable either under section 134(4) of the 1913 Act or section 220 of the 1956 Act.\nDismissing the appeal to this Court, HELD : On principle and authority it should be held that no offence was committed under section 220 of the.\n[417B] (a) The principle accepted by this Court in State of Bombay vs Bandhan Ram Bhandani [1961] 1 S.C.R_ 801, that a company or its directors in a prosecution under sections 32 and 133 of the 1913 Act, could not, in defence to such prosecution, rely upon their own failure to call the general body meeting would not apply to a prosecution under section 134 of the 1913 Act or section 220 of the 1956 Act.\nUnlike sections 32 and 133, the responsibility of I sending to the Registrar the copies of the balance sheet and profit and loss account arises only after they have been laid before the company at the general meeting, the obligation to do so being completely dependent on its being laid before a general meeting.\n[414H 415E] (b) Where the words in the section are clear it is unnecessary to consider whether it embodies any principle and whether that principle is consistent with the principle as embodied in other sections which are differently worded.\nIn interpreting a penal provision it is not permissible to give an extended meaning to the plain words of the section on the ground of a principle recognised\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInput: Appeal No. 1604 of 1967.\nFrom the judgment and order dated the 8th February, 1967 of Le Delhi High Court in Civil Writ No. 531 D of 1964.\nP.P.

The High Court, however, allowed the writ petition and set aside the conviction and the sentence. The High Court held that the Federation was not an \"establishment\" as defined in s. 2(9) of the Act and, therefore, the Secretary of the Federation was not in charge of an establishment and could not be prosecuted under the Act.

The High Court also held that the Federation was engaged in the business of selling goods, which was not an activity carried out by an establishment under the Act.\nThe main contentions of the Appellant 2 (Chief Inspector of Shops and Establishments, Delhi) before us are as follows: (i) The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, New Delhi is a commercial establishment as defined in s. 2(9) of the Act. (ii) The sale of goods by the Federation is an activity carried out by an establishment under the Act.\nWe have been directed by the High Court to decide the question whether the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, New Delhi is a \"commercial establishment\" within the meaning of s. 2(9) of the Act.\nTo determine this\nActual: The respondent was required by the Chief Inspector of Shops and Establishments to register its establishment'under the Delhi Shops and Establishments Act, 1954.\nThe respondent contended that it was not an 'establishment'which is defined in section 2(9) as meaning 'a shop or a commercial estab lishment'and did not comply with the direction.\nProceedings for prosecution of its Secretary were instituted, where upon the respondent filed a petition in the High Court for quashing the order of the appellant and for directing the Magistrate not to proceed with the complaint.\nBefore the High Court the appellant contended that the respondent was a 'commercial establishment'because, the activity of the respondent amounted to a 'Profession ', and alternatively, that the case fell within the latter part of the definition of 'commercial establishment'in section 2(5), inasmuch as its activities were connected with trade and business generally, but, it was not urged that the activity of the respondent amounted to carrying on any 'business or trade'in its premises.\nThe writ petition was allowed by the High Court, holding that premises of the respondent were not a 'commercial establishment '.\nIn appeal to this Court it was contended that the activities of the respondent amounted to a 'trade or business ', that therefore it was a 'commercial establishment'and that the matter was covered by Management of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry vs Sri R. K. Mittal [1972] 2 S.C.R. 353.\nAllowing the appeal.\nHELD : (1) It is not proper to shut out the contentions of the appellant now raised about the activity of the respondent being a 'trade or business'merely on the ground that the point was not properly put before the High Court.\nThe question is only one of drawing a correct inference about the point in issue from the material already on record and will not require any additional material for decision.\n[354E F] (2)A place, in order to fall within the definition of 'commercial establishment'must, in the first instance, be 'premises '.\nand secondly, should be premises wherein, (a) any trade, business or profession is carried on, or (b) any work in connection with or incidental or ancillary thereto is carried on.\n[353C D] (3) The registered office of the respondent is 'premises '.\n[353D] (4) All the activities of the respondent are business activities\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInput: Civil Appeal No. 159 of 1974.\nFrom the Judgment and Order dated 4 4 1973 of the Punjab and Haryana High Court at Chandigarh in R.S.A.

No. 1482 of 1961.\n488 N. N. Goswamy and Arvind Minocha, for the appellant.\nKapil Sibbal and D. Probir Mitra, for respondents.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by MATHEW, J.\nThis is an appeal by special leave against a decree passed by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana holding that the appeal filed by the plaintiff appellant has abated and dismissing his suit.\nThe appellant brought the suit on the allegation that there was one Shiromani Nirankari Dera at Patiala, that this institution had two branches one at Landeke in Moga Tehsil and the other at Nanga Kheri in the erstwhile Patiala State, and that he, as mahant in charge of the Shiromani Dera at Patiala had the right to manage the properties attached to the Dera at Landeke.\nThe prayer in the plaint was for recovery of possession of the Dera and the properties attached to it.\nSom Dass, the defendant, contended that the Dera at Landeke was an independent Dera and that he was in possession of the properties of the Dera as its lawfully appointed mahant.\nThe trial court decreed the suit.\nIn appeal by the defendant the decree was reversed.\nAgainst that decree, an appeal was preferred by the appellant to the High Court.\nWhile the appeal was pending in the High Court, Som Dass, the defendant, died on 13 10 1970.\nNo application was made by the appellant to bring on record his legal representatives within the period prescribed.\nAn application was made on 1 2 1971 by the appellant stating that Som Dass died on 26 11 1970 leaving behind him Shiam Dass as his Chela and for impleading him.\nThe correctness of the date of death of Som Dass was contested by Shiam Dass.\nThe High Court referred the question to the trial Court for enquiry and decision.\nThe trial Court, after taking evidence, found that Som Dass died on 13 10 1970.\nThereafter the appellant prayed before the High Court that his application dated 1 2 1971 might be treated as an application for setting aside the abatement of the appeal and the ground for setting aside the abatement was that the appellant did not know about the death of Som Dass at the time he died.\nThe High Court found no substance in the plea that the appellant had no knowledge about the date of the death of Som Dass and held that the appeal had abated and that there was no ground for setting aside the abatement.\nThe appellant had raised an alternative contention before the High Court that there was no abatement of the appeal even if Som Dass was not impleaded within the period prescribed as he claimed to represent the dera as its duly elected Chela.\nThe High Court held that after the death of Som Dass, Shiam Dass, as his Chela \"inherited the sum total of the rights which earlier vested in Som Dass and when a controversy is raised about such rights, then the appellant was bound to bring on record the legal representatives of the deceased within the time prescribed by law.\n\" 489 We do not think that the view of the High Court was correct.\nThe suit was filed on the basis that the appellant as the lawfully appointed mahant was entitled to manage the properties of the Dera at Landeke, that the defendant was unlawfully claiming to be the mahant of the Dera and entitled to manage the properties of the Dera, and that the appellant was entitled to be in possession of the properties.\nAs already stated the contention of the defendant was that though the properties belonged to the Dera, he was its lawfully appointed mahant and that the appellant had no right to recover possession of the property of the Dera.\nWhen Som Dass died, the interest which was the subject matter of the suit, devolved upon Shiam Das as he was elected to be the Mahant of the Dera and the appeal could be continued under Q. 22, r. 10, of the Civil Procedure Code against the person upon whom the interest had devolved.\nOrder 22, rule 10 reads: \"R. 10(1) In other cases of an assignment, creation or devolution of any interest during the pendency of suit, the suit may, by leave of the Court, be continued by or against the person to or upon whom such interest has come or devolved.\n(2) The attachment of a decree pending an appeal there from shall be deemed to be an interest entitling the person who procured such attachment to the benefit of sub rule (1).\n\" The High Court failed to consider the provisions of Order 22, rule 10 of the Civil Procedure Code.\nHence the finding of the High Court was not correct.\nThe appeal will be allowed and the decree of the High Court will be set aside.\nIn view of this finding, the appeal will have to be remitted back to the High Court for further consideration on the basis of the finding of the Court.\nThe High Court may take into account the findings of the trial Court and the evidence adduced by the parties on the question of the date of death of Som Dass and also consider the provisions of Order 22, rule 10 of the Civil Procedure Code.\nThe parties will be at liberty to adduce further evidence on the above aspect.\nIn view of the above, the appeal will be allowed.\nThe appellant is entitled to have the appeal remitted back to the High Court for further consideration on the basis of the finding of the Court.\nThe judgment of the High Court will be set aside and the appeal will be allowed.

I woke up on hearing a noise to the effect 'younger brother, Karunakaran is running after stabbing me with knife, 'catch him '.\nI stood up and saw Karunakaran, son of Orathur Ayyathurai Padayachi running eastwards from the place where I lay and my elder brother chasing him from behind.\nI too came running\".\nIt will be seen that at the time of lodging of the first information report only the present accused was implicated.\nEven so, later on, two more accused were added to the list of accused persons.\nThe police had submitted charge sheet against the accused and also against two other accused persons.\nThe accused were charged under sections 302/34 IPC.\nThe trial was held in two stages, first stage was held at the court of the Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Boothagudi, and the accused were convicted and sentenced to death.\nOn appeal by the accused, the conviction and sentence were set aside by the Sessions Judge at Dindigul and the case was remitted to the court of the Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Boothagudi for retrial.\nThe retrial was also completed and the accused were once again convicted and sentenced to death.\nHence, this appeal.\nThe accused was found to be a member of a political organization.\nThe accused had a history of violence against the police and the accused had also been accused of various other crimes.\nThe prosecution's case is based on the testimony of Pandurangam PW 4, Gnanasakaran PW 1 and Thiru gnanasambandam PW 3.\nThe accused Karunakaran had allegedly gone to the place of occurrence with the intention of killing the deceased.\nThe accused had a long-standing grudge against the deceased and the deceased had also been involved in a previous case against the accused.\nThe accused had also been accused of various other crimes.\nThe prosecution also relies on the evidence of PW 16 the post-mortem doctor who had performed the post-mortem examination.\nThe accused Karunakaran had inflicted severe injuries on the deceased and had also tried to kill Pandurangam PW 4.\nThe accused had also been accused of various other crimes.\nThe accused had a history of violence against the police and the accused had also been accused of various other crimes.\nThe accused Karunakaran was found to be the main accused in the case.\nThe accused had a long-standing grudge against the deceased and the deceased had also been involved in a previous case against the accused.\nThe accused Karunakaran had allegedly gone to the place of occurrence with the intention of killing the deceased.\nThe accused had inflicted severe injuries on the deceased and had also tried to kill Pandurangam PW 4.\nThe accused had a history of violence against the police and the accused had also been accused of various other crimes.\nThe accused Karunakaran was found to be the main accused in the case.\nThe accused had a long-standing grudge against the deceased and the deceased\nActual: The appellant along with \"J\" & '.T\" was charged for offences u/s 120B/109/ 302 I.P.C. as well as 302/34 I.P.C. The trial which proceeded in the absence of absconding \"T\", resulted in the conviction and both the accused were sentenced to death sentence.\nOn a reference and appeals by the accused the High Court acquitted \"J\" rejecting four out of five eye witnesses and disbelieving even the only other eye witness who lodged the First Information Report.\nThe High Court however maintained the conviction and confirmed the death sentence on the appellant relying on the testimony of the very same single witness.\non appeal by special leave, the Court ^ HELD: (i) Ordinarily in an appeal under article 136 of the Constitution the Court would hesitate to go into the facts to reappreciate the evidence.\nIt is, however.\nnot possible to adopt that course, where the testimony of the sole witness has been rejected with reference to the second accused was on the same boat with the appellant.\nWhen the accused is going to lose his life in such a serious charge u/s 302 I.P.C. it is only necessary that the Court should be circumspect and closely scrutinise the evidence to come to an unhesitating conclusion that the sole single witness is absolutely reliable.\n[710G, H, 711H, 712A] (ii) In the instant case, the High Court was not correct in appreciating the ocular testimony of a sole witness, because (a) the very fact that the eye witness could be persuaded to substitute PWs.\n1, 2. and 3 for his deceased brother as chasing the assailants, contrary to the version of the F.I.R. degrades him from the status of an absolutely reliable witness, not having a qualm of conscience, but an obliging and untrustworthy witness.\n[710H] (b) 'The version in the F.I.R. stands contradicted by the testimony in court on a very material point and does not corroborate.\n[712 B] (c ) Placing such reliance.\ntherefore.\nas is requisite on the testimony of the uncorroborated solitary witness for convicting the accused facing a murder charge is not possible in the case.

(3).\nThe High Court pointed out that in both these cases what was decided was whether \"welding electrodes\", considered by themselves, were \"electrical goods\" falling within entry 41 of Schedule 1 of the Madras General Sales Tax Act.\nIt was held, in these cases, that they were only copper rods which were melted by electrical power in the process of welding.\nNeither the use of the term \"electrode\" to describe them, suggesting a connection with electricity, nor their utilisation in a process involving application of electrical power could convert them into \"electrical goods\" as contemplated by the entry in the Madras Act.\nThe High Court rightly observed that these decisions had no bearing whatsoever upon the very different entry in a schedule of an entirely different Act of a different State.\nThe same question has been argued before us with the help of some more cases to which the same criticism applies.\nThe additional cases cited before us were: Pashabhai Patel & Co.(P) Ltd. vs Collector of Sales Tax, Maharashtra State(4), where it was held a \"tractor\" (1) T.R.C. No. 26 of 2962 (decided on 9th August, 1963) (2) (1968) 22 S.T.C. 172 (Madras) (3) (1968) 22 S.T.C. 476 (Madras) (4) (1964) 15 S.T.C.32.\n563 is not \"agricultural machinery\", within the meaning of entry 9 in Schedule of the Bombay Sales Tax Act, 1953; Agrawal Brothers vs Commissioner of Sales Tax, Madhya Pradesh(1); where it was also held that a \"tractor\", which is \"nothing but a self propelled vehicle capable of pulling a load\", or \"traction\" does not acquire the character of \"agricultural machinery or implement\", merely because it is used in agricultural operations. In the latter two cases, the High Court was of the view that the decisions cited were not relevant to the question before it.\nThe High Court also observed that the definition clause in the Act defines \"sales tax\" as \"the tax levied by the Government on the sale or purchase of any goods or property, or on the value added to goods or property in the course of manufacture or sale thereof\".\nThe High Court was of the view that the definition clause would show that the tax is levied on the value added to goods or property in the course of manufacture or sale thereof.\nHence, the High Court, in our opinion, rightly held that the fact that arc carbons were manufactured for cinema use, did not render them outside the purview of the Act.\nThe High Court was also of the view that the Act is a comprehensive Act and the words \"goods\" and \"property\" used in the Act are to be interpreted in a wide sense.\nThe High Court further held that the entry under consideration links the taxable object with its general or ordinary use. It was, therefore, open to the taxing authorities to consider the use to which the arc carbons were generally made.\nThe High Court was of the view that the question before it was not one of interpretation of the entry in the Schedule of the Act but whether the arc carbons came under the definition of \"goods\" or \"property\" under the Act.\nThe High Court, therefore, rightly held that arc carbons, manufactured for cinema use, fall within the purview of the Act.\nThe fact that arc carbons manufactured by the company in question were for cinema use is not a relevant factor in determining whether they came within the purview of the Act.\nIn our opinion, the High Court's view is correct and the order of the Sales Tax Appellate Tribunal is liable to be set aside.\nWe, therefore, allow the appeals, set aside the order of the Sales Tax Appellate Tribunal and restore the order of the Deputy Commissioner of Sales Tax, Madras Division, Madurai.\nThe appeals are allowed.\n(1) 1962 APTR 145 (2) 1960 APTR 111 (3) 1964 APTR 38 (4) 1966 APTR 155 (1) 1961 APTR 159 (2) 1963 APTR 143 (1) (1966) 23 STC 137 (Madras) (2) (196\nActual: Entry 4 of the I Schedule of the Andhra Pradesh General Sales Tax Act, 1957, reads: Cinematographic equipment including. parts and accessories required for use therewith.\non the question whether Arc Carbons, known as 'Cinama Arc Carbons'manufactured by the appellant fall under the entry and their sales were, there fore, rightly subjected to sales tax.\n^ HELD: The meaning of an entry can only be satisfactorily determined in the light of the language of the entry itself considered in the context in which it occurs.\nand cases relating to totally different entries will have only a very remote bearing.\nEntry 4 occurs in a Schedule of taxable goods.\nWhen it was intended to confine an entry to particular gadgets and 'parts thereof'the entry said so.\nEntry 4, however, includes 'parts'as well as 'accessories '.\nThe term 'accessories'is used to describe goods which may have been manufactured for use as an aid or addition to particular machines, though, they may serve as aids to other kinds of instruments also.\nBut, this entry and other entries use the expression'required for use therewith '.\nThe description of the goods in these entries indicates that the expression has been employed for equipment or accessories connected with the main purpose.\nTherefore, it is its general of predominant use that determines the category in which an article will fall.\n[563D F, G; 564B C] In the present case, the main use of Arc Carbons was proved to be that of production of powerful light used in projectors in Cinemas.\nThe fact that they can also be used for other purposes such as for search lights etc., will not detract from their classification under Entry 4.\nThe classification is determined by their ordinary or common known purpose or user which is evident from he fact thy are known as 'cinema Arc Carbons'in the market.\n[564 F H]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInput: Civil Appeal No. 1231 of 1968.\nAppeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated the 20th December 1962 of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay in Civil Appeal No. 151 of 1960.\nB.

Khandesh) was a private Devasthan or a public religious trust.\nThere was a saint endowed with spiritual powers by the name of Sakharam Maharaj at Amalner.\nThe deity of his worship was Shri Vithal Rukhamai.\nAlthough the origin of the Sansthan is dipped somewhat in antiquity and direct testimony was lacking, it has never been disputed that Sakharam Maharaj constructed a temple in the year 1817 at Amalner and installed the aforesaid deity according to religious rites.\nHe also acquired certain properties and the said temple with the properties constituted Shri Vithal Rukhamai Sansthan of Amalner.\nThe sansthan had movable property of the value of Rs. 19,164/ and immovable properties of the value of Rs. 1,06,000/ and the average gross annual income as well as the average annual expenditure was Rs. 11,000/.\nAfter the passing of the Bombay Public Trusts Act, 1950 (No. 29 of 1950) (briefly the Act) an application under section 18 of that Act was filed by three persons Bhaskarrao Chimanrao Deshmukh, Ramrao Sahebrao Deshmukh and Ramkrishna Tryambak Deshpande, as constituted attorneys of Vasudeobuwa who was described in the application as the \"owner\" of the property.\nThe word 'Buwa'means saint.\nThe application was made on May 29, 1952, to the Assistant Charity Commissioner, Poona, under protest and without prejudice 520 to the claim made therein that the Sansthan was not a public trust.\nIn view of the penal provision under section 66 of the Act in the case of non compliance with section 18(1) of the Act the said application was made ex abundanti cautela.\nThe Assistant Charity Commissioner after requisite notice made an enquiry into the matter in accordance with the provisions of the Act.\nOn behalf of the applicants representing the Sansthan evidence of the attorney Ramkrishna Deshpande was recorded and he was cross examined by the assessors as well as by the Assistant Charity Commissioner.\nSome documents were also produced on behalf of the Sansthan.\nThree witnesses were examined on behalf of the Assistant Charity Commissioner and were afforded an opportunity to the applicants'pleader for cross examination.\nAt the close of the enquiry the Assistant Charity Commissioner by his order of August 25, 1956, held the Sansthan to be a public trust and ordered its registration as a public trust under the Act.\nThe applicants thereupon filed an appeal under section 70 of the Act before the Charity Commissioner, Bombay, who by his order of August 31, 1957, affirmed the decision of the Assistant Charity Commissioner.\nThat led to an application under section 72 of the Act to the District Judge of West Khandesh at Dhulia which was duly filed on behalf of Purshottambuwa who meanwhile succeeded Guru Vasudeobuwa as \"owner\" of the Sansthan.\nThe learned District Judge reversed the decision of the Charity Commissioner by his order of October 16, 1959, and declared the Sansthan to be a private property and not a public trust.\nThe Charity Commissioner then appealed under section 72(4) of the Act to the High Court of Bombay.\nThe High Court by its order of 19/20th December, 1962, set aside the order of the District Judge and held the Sansthan to be a public trust under the Act and restored the order of the Charity Commissioner.\nHence this appeal by special leave which was obtained on March 29, 1968, after condonation of delay, in the peculiar circumstances of the case arising out of revocation by the High Court of its earlier certificate in favour of the appellant on account of default of deposit of security.\nAs noted earlier there was both oral and documentary evidence adduced in this case.\nThe learned District Judge relied mostly on the documentary evidence for his conclusion in favour of the appellant.\nThe High Court took note of both oral as well as documentary evidence.\nThe High Court particularly relied upon an admission of the appellant's witness, Ramkrishna Deshpande, when he stated that he had never been a member of the management board of the Sansthan and that he was merely a hired attorney for the Sansthan.\nThis admission has been found by the High Court to be crucial for its conclusion in favour of the respondent.\nThe High Court, however, did not take into account the oral evidence of the three witnesses examined on behalf of the respondents.\nThe High Court further took into account the oral evidence of the three witnesses who had been examined on behalf of the respondent.\nIn this appeal, the main argument of the learned counsel for the appellant is that the High Court erred in relying upon the oral evidence of the three witnesses examined on behalf of the respondent and that the High Court should have taken into account the oral evidence of the three witnesses who were examined on behalf of the appellant.\nThe learned counsel for the respondent, on the other hand, relies upon the oral evidence of the three witnesses examined on behalf of the respondent and submits that the High Court was right in relying upon the oral evidence of the three witnesses who were examined on behalf of the respondent.\nIn this appeal, the High Court has set aside the order of the District Judge and held the Sansthan to be a public trust.\nIt is now contended by the learned counsel for the respondent that the High Court was right in relying upon the oral evidence of the three witnesses who were examined on behalf of the respondent.\nThe High Court has not set aside the finding of the learned District Judge that the Sansthan was a private trust.\nThe High Court has not set aside the finding of the learned District Judge that the Sansthan was not a public trust.\nThe finding of the learned District Judge has been upheld by the High Court in respect of the ownership of the Sansthan by Vasudeobuwa.\nThe High Court has, however, set aside the finding of the learned District Judge that the Sansthan was a private trust.\nIt is, therefore, the case of the learned counsel for the respondent that the High Court was right in relying upon the oral evidence of the three witnesses who were examined on behalf of the respondent and that the High Court was right in holding that the Sansthan was a public trust.\nIn this appeal, the learned counsel for the respondent relies upon the oral evidence of the three witnesses who were examined on behalf of the respondent.\nThe High Court relied upon the oral evidence of the three witnesses who were examined on behalf of the respondent.\nThe High Court also took note of the admission of Ramkrishna

ascertained or capable of being ascertained; in a private trust, they are the general public or a class thereof which is incapable of being ascertained.\n[526C] (2) The intention of the founder as to whether specified individuals or the general public or any specified portion thereof could have the right of worship.\n[526E] (3) When property is dedicated for the worship of a family idol, it is a

Jain and Mrs. Laxmi Arvid for Re spondent Nos.\n1(2) In C.A. 631/76.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by SHINGHAL, J.\nThese two are companion appeals by special leave.\nThey have been heard together at the in stance.\nof the learned counsel for the parties, and will be disposed by a common judgment.\nAppeal No. 1951 of 1975 is directed against the award of the Industrial Tribunal Gujarat, dated September 24, 1975, in the dispute between the Alembic Glass Industries Ltd., Baroda, and its workmen, while appeal No. 631 of 1976 arises out of the Tribunal's award in the dispute between Jyoti Limited, Baroda, and its workmen.\nSpeaking broadly, the dispute in both cases related to the workmen's demand for 10 days sick leave, with retrospective effect, and,its accumulation over a period of three years i.e. upto 30 days.\nThe workmen particularly felt aggrieved because by virtue of the first proviso to section 49 of the, hereinafter referred to as the Act, they were not entitled to the sickness benefit for the first two days of sickness except in the case of a, spell of sickness following, at an interval of not more than 15 days, the spell of sickness for which sickness benefit was last paid.\nIt was also a grievance that the benefit under the scheme of the Act was much less than the normal earnings of an employee and was not beneficial to the workmen.\nThe demand was resisted by the Companies in both cases.\nIn the case of the Alembic Glass Industries Ltd., it was contended that the Act provided more than adequate sickness benefits, and any additional 82 benefit would place unproductive financial burden on the industry and would have an all round adverse effect on other industries.\nIt was also urged that section 99 of the Act gave wide powers to the Employees'State Insurance Corpora tion to enhance the benefit and it was therefore the proper authority to examine the demand.\nThe Company also contended that there was no practice of giving any such sick leave in the industries in Baroda or in the State of Gujarat.\nIn the case of Jyoti Ltd. an objection was taken that the reference was incompetent and the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to entertain it.\nIt was also pointed out that the benefit of sick.leave of 7 days per year was initially given to the workmen under an award dated August 29, 1958 which contained a specific direction that it would be automatically discon tinued when the benefits of the Employees'State Insurance scheme would become available to the workmen, and also that the reasonableness of the demand could not be examined by the Tribunal.\nAn objection was also taken that the workmen had benefited a lot under the entire scheme of the Act and it would not be reasonable and proper to confer any addi tional benefit as the demands would place a heavy financial burden on the Company which it Could not bear.\nThe demand, according to the Company, would create an absurd position inasmuch as a worker would receive more wages by remaining absent than on duty.\nThe Company also pleaded that the demand for sickness leave could not be granted retrospec tively or allowed to accumulate.\nWhile the reference in the case of Jyoti Ltd., Baroda, was still pending, the Tribunal gave its award dated Septem ber 24, 1975 in the case of the Alembic Glass Industries Ltd. The Tribunal, inter alia, awarded 7 days sick leave with full pay and dearness allowance to the workmen of that Company in a year, with effect from 1st January, 1975, and also allowed the workmen to accumulate such leave for a period of 3 years with effect from 1st January, 1974.\nThe Tribunal also directed the Company to pay to each workman a compensation of Rs. 500 in addition to the sickness benefit and to pay interest on the amount of the sickness benefit at the rate of 6 paise per rupee per month.\nThe workmen were not satisfied with the award and, therefore, they have preferred these appeals.\nIn the case of the Alembic Glass Industries Ltd., the Tribunal, after considering the objections raised by the Company, observed that the Act was a social legislation aimed at providing adequate protection to the workmen and to ensure that they are not put in a precarious position in the event of sickness.\nIt was also observed that the Company could not be allowed to exploit the workmen and that the workmen had a legitimate claim to the benefit of sickness leave.\nThe Tribunal observed that the demand of the workmen was reasonable and that the Companies had not taken adequate measures to prevent the occurrence of sickness among the workmen.\nThe Tribunal further observed that the benefit under the Act was not sufficient to meet the needs of the workmen and that the Companies should be required to provide additional benefits to the workmen.\nThe Tribunal, therefore, allowed the demand of the workmen, inter alia, for 7 days sick leave with full pay and dearness allowance to the workmen in a year, with effect from 1st January, 1975, and also allowed the workmen to accumulate such leave for a period of 3 years with effect from 1st January, 1974.\nThe Tribunal also directed the Company to pay to each workman a compensation of Rs. 500 in addition to the sickness benefit and to pay interest on the amount of the sickness benefit at the rate of 6 paise per rupee per month.\nIn the case of Jyoti Ltd., Baroda, the Tribunal observed that the reference was competent and the Tribunal had jurisdiction to entertain it.\nThe Tribunal further observed that the demand of the workmen was reasonable and that the Companies had not taken adequate measures to prevent the occurrence of sickness among the workmen.\nThe Tribunal, therefore, allowed the demand of the workmen, inter alia, for 10 days sick leave with full pay and dearness allowance to the workmen in a year, with effect from 1st January, 1974, and also\nActual: The workmen's demand for grant of sick leave and its accumulation upto a period was rejected by the employers on the ground that the provided more than adequate sickness benefits, and that any additional benefits would place a financial burden on the industry and would adversely affect other industries in the region.\nThe Tribunal, to which the dispute was referred, partly granted the workmen's demand.\nOn appeal to this Court it was contended that section 61 of the debarred a person enti tled to any of the benefits under that Act from receiving similar benefit under the provisions of any other Act and as such the workmen were not entitled to the benefit of sick leave.\nDismissing the appeals, HELD: (1) The, does not deal with the question of sick leave.\nThe scheme of the benefits admissible under the Act does not cover the work men's demand for sick leave to the extent allowed by the Tribunal.\nSection 61 is not applicable because the benefits granted by the Tribunal are not similar to those admissible under the Act.\n[84 C] The Hindustan Times Ltd., New Delhi vs Their Workmen [1964] 1 SCR 234 and Technological Institute of Textiles vs Its Workmen and others applied.\n(2) Sickness benefit under the Act cannot be said to be adequate, for, it works out to about half the average wage of a workman which benefit is not admissible for the first two days of sickness except under the conditions provided in the Act.\nA workman is prevented from earning the normal daily wages during the period of his illness and there is no justification for the argument that the rate of benefit at about half his wage, under the Act, should be considered sufficient so as to deny him the benefit of sick leave on full emoluments for a period of 7 days when he is certi fied by a competent medical officer to be ill for that or a longer period.\nSickness is a serious misfortune to a work man for it not only prevents him from earning his normal wages, but is a drain on his meagre financial resources by way of additional expenditure on food, nursing and visits to the medical centre etc.\n[84 E F] (3) The Tribunal could not be said to have erred in restoring the benefit which the workmen were receiving under an earlier award.\nThe benefit of sick leave to the employ ees in the region was lost when the Act was made applicable to the region from December 14, 1969.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInput: N: Criminal Appeals Nos.\n39 40 of 1976.\n(From the Judgment and Order dated 1 12 1975 of the Punjab

13 of the Bombay City Land Revenue Act, 1876, requiring the assessee to appear before him in person on the 16th June 1955 and show cause why he, the assessee, should not be apprehended and confined to civil jail in satisfaction of the said certified demand.\nThe assessee did not appear in person on the appointed day but on the next day, the 17th June 1955, an Advocate acting on behalf of the assessee wrote a letter to the Additional Collector purporting to show cause why the assessee should not be arrested and sent to the civil jail.\nThe contentions put forward on behalf of the assessee not being considered satisfactory the Additional Collector on the 30th June 1955 issued a warrant for the arrest of the assessee under section 13 of the Bombay City Land Revenue Act, 1876.\nThe assessee was actually arrested on the 1st July 1955.\nOn the 8th July 1955 an application was made by the present petitioner to the Bombay High Court under article 226 complaining of the arrest of his father, the assessee, and praying for a writ in the nature of a writ of habeas corpus for the production and release of the assessee.\nA rule was issued by the High Court but eventually on the 24th August 1955 the High Court (Chagla, C.J. and Desai, J.) discharged the rule.\nNo application was made to the High Court for leave to appeal to this Court from the decision of that High Court but on the 2nd September 1955 the present petitioner filed this rule petition under article 32 of the Constitution.\nIt may be noted that the High Court in the discharge of the rule had relied upon the fact that the assessee was not produced before the High Court at the time of the discharge of the rule and that the High Court had considered that the assessee was not required to be produced before the High Court for the purpose of the discharge of the rule.\nThe main contention of the petitioner is that the High Court had erred in the said view.\nThe main contention of the respondent is that the High Court had rightly discharged the rule as the assessee was not required to be produced before the High Court at the time of the discharge of the rule.\nIn order to answer the question posed by the rule petition, it is necessary to consider the provisions of Article 32 of the Constitution and the principles governing the issue of a writ of habeas corpus.\nThe writ of habeas corpus is a writ of general nature which is available against any person who holds another in custody and who is subject to the jurisdiction of the High Court.\nThe High Court has the power to issue this writ to any person who is being detained in custody without authority of law or without legal authority.\nThe High Court has to consider whether the detention is lawful or not and if it is not lawful then the High Court can issue the writ of habeas corpus.\nThe main condition for the issue of a writ of habeas corpus is that the person detained must be produced before the High Court and the person detaining him must be shown to be acting in excess of his lawful authority.\nIt is not necessary for the High Court to be satisfied that the person detained was wrongfully detained at the time of the hearing of the writ petition.\nThe High Court has to merely consider whether the detention was lawful or not and if it is not lawful then the High Court can issue the writ of habeas corpus.\nThe High Court will have to examine the case of the person detained and the person detaining him and the High Court will have to decide whether the detention is lawful or not.\nThe High Court will also have to examine the case of the person detaining the person who is being detained and the High Court will have to decide whether the person detaining him is acting in excess of his lawful authority.\nThe High Court will have to examine the record of the case of the person detained and the High Court will have to decide whether the detention was lawful or not.\nThe High Court will also have to examine the record of the\nActual: The assesses carrying on business in the City of Bombay was assessed to income tax for the years 1943 44 to 1947 48 and 1951 52 by the Income tax Officer C 1 Ward Bombay.\nAs the assessee did not pay the income tax due the Income tax Officer issued in April 1951 to the Additional Collector of Bombay a recovery certificate under section 46(2) of the Indian Income tax Act, 1922.\nIn February 1954 the Additional Collector issued a notice of demand and as no payment was made he attached the good will and tenancy rights of the assessee's premises by a warrant of attachment dated 24th March 1954, 888 A sale was held in February 1955.\nThe sale proceeds not being sufficient to satisfy the assessed tax the Additional Collector issued a notice under section 13 of the Bombay City Land Revenue Act, 1876 requiring the assessee to appear before him and show cause why he should not be apprehended and confined to civil prison in satisfaction of the said certified demand.\nIn default of assessee's appearance and showing cause a warrant for his arrest was issued under section 13 of the Bombay Act, II of 1876 and he was actually arrested on 1st July 1955.\nAn application to the Bombay High Court under article 226 of the Constitution for a writ in the nature of a writ of habeas corpus having proved unsuccessful, an application under article 32 was filed in the Supreme Court for the same relief.\nTwo main points urged on behalf of the assessee were: (a) that section 46(2) of the Indian Income tax Act under which the Income tax Officer issued the recovery certificate to the Additional Collector of Bombay was void, under article 13 (1) of the Constitution in that it offended article 21 and article 14 of the Constitution; (b)that section 13 of the Bombay Land Revenue Act, 1876 (Bombay Act II of 1876) under which the warrant of arrest was issued by the Additional Collector was void under article 13(1) of the Constitution as the same was repugnant to article 14 of the Constitution.\nHeld (as regards a) (1) that there was no violation of fundamental rights under article 21 of the Constitution inasmuch as section 13 of the Bombay Act II of 1876 under which warrant of arrest was issued for the recovery of the demand certified under section 46(\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInput: Appeal No. 205 of

Dhebar, with him), for the respondent.\nNovember 10.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by VENKATARAMA AYYAR J.\nThis appeal raises a question as to the powers of a Custodian of Evacuee Property to cancel a lease granted by him under section 12 of the (XXXI of 1950), hereinafter referred to as the Act.\nMessrs Abdul Karim and Brothers owned, along with certain other properties which are not the subject matter of the present appeal, three mills with bungalows and chawls at Ambernath in Thana District and the Bobbin Factory at Tardeo in Bombay.\nThey having migrated to Pakistan, these properties were declared by a notification dated 12 9 1951 issued under section 7 of the Act as evacuee property, and under section 8(1) of the Act, they became vested in the respondent as the Custodian for the State.\nThe appellants are displaced persons, and on 30 8 1952 the respondent entered into an agreement with them, Exhibit A, which is, as aptly characterised by learned counsel for the appellants, of a composite character, consisting of three distinct matters.\nThere was, firstly, a demise under which the mills and the factory in question were leased to the appellants for a period of five years on the terms and conditions set out therein.\nSecondly, there was a sale of the stock of raw materials, unsold finished goods, spare parts, cars, trucks and other movables which were in the mills and the factory, with elaborate provisions for the determination and payment of the price therefor in 979 due course.\nAnd thirdly, there was an agreement to sell the mills and the factory to the appellants in certain events and subject to certain conditions.\nThere was also a clause for referring the disputes between the parties to arbitration.\nIn pursuance of this agreement, the appellants were put in possession of the mills and the factory on 31 8 1952.\nOn 12 2 1954 the respondent issued a notice to the appellants, Exhibit C, wherein be set out that the appellants had systematically committed breaches of the various terms on which the properties bad been leased to them, and called upon them to show cause why the lease should not be cancelled and why they should not be evicted.\nThe notice then went on to state that the respondent considered it necessary to issue certain directions for the \"preservation of the demised premises and the goods and stock in trade, etc., lying in the demised premises\", and the appellants were accordingly required not to remove the stock or raise any money on the security thereof, and to send daily reports to the Custodian, of the transactions with reference thereto.\nPresumably, these directions were given under section 10 of the Act.\nOn 13 2 1954 the appellants appeared before the respondent, and contended that he had no auth ority to issue the notice in question under section 12, and that it was therefore illegal.\nApprehending that the lease might be cancelled, and that they might be evicted, the appellants filed on 16 2 1954 the application out of which the present appeal arises, for a writ of certiorari for quashing the notice, Exhibit C, and for a writ of prohibition restraining the respondent from taking any further action pursuant thereto.\nIn support of the petition, the appellants urged that section 12 under which the respondent purported to act authorised the cancellation of only leases granted by the evacuee and not by the Custodian himself, and that no directions could be given under section 10 as it applied only to properties of the evacuee, and that by reason of the sale, the movables in question had become the property of the appel 124 980 lants.\nThe petition was heard by Tendolkar, J., who stated the points for determination thus: (1) \"Whether the Custodian has power under section 12 of the, to terminate a lease granted by himself, and (2) Whether the directions given by the Custodian are beyond the jurisdiction conferred upon him by section 10 of the said Act?\" On the first question, he held that section 12 of the Act, specifically mentioned \"leases granted by the evacuee\" and therefore, the Custodian had no power to terminate a lease granted by the evacuee. On the second question, he held that the Custodian had jurisdiction to give the directions under section 10 of the Act. The petition was therefore dismissed.\nOn appeal to the Bombay High Court, it was contended by the learned counsel for the appellants that section 12 of the Act, specifically mentioned \"leases granted by the evacuee\" and therefore, the Custodian had no power to terminate a lease granted by the evacuee, and that the Custodian's powers under section 10 of the Act were limited to the properties of the evacuee. On the other hand, the learned counsel for the respondent argued that the Custodian's powers under section 12 of the Act were not limited to the evacuee, but extended to the property which had been vested in him under section 8(1) of the Act.\nIn this appeal, the question for consideration is whether the Custodian has the power to cancel a lease granted by him under section 12 of the Act. This is the only question which was actually decided by the High Court in the appeal before us, and hence, it is the only question which is raised in this appeal.\nThe language of section 12 of the Act is quite clear. It states that \"Where any evacuee property has been leased by the Custodian for any period, the Custodian may, by notice in writing to the lessee, terminate the lease in the manner provided by this section.\" It is not a question of whether the Custodian can terminate a lease granted by the evacuee, but whether the Custodian himself can terminate a lease granted by him.\nIn this connection, it may be seen that section 8(1) of the Act states that \"All property of evacuees which, immediately before the commencement of this Act, was in the occupation of an evacuee, and all movable property and all immovable property belonging to an evacuee shall be deemed to be property of the Custodian for the State.\" Therefore, it is not incorrect in saying that the Custodian is the owner of the property which has been vested in him under section 8(1) of the Act.\nTherefore, the question for consideration is whether the Custodian has the power to terminate a lease granted by himself. It is clear that the Custodian can grant a lease under\nActual: By section\n,12, sub section 1, of the (XXXI of 1950) as amended by Act XLII of 1954, notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, the Custodian may cancel any allotment or terminate any lease or amend the terms of any lease or agreement under which any evacuee property is held or occupied by a person, whether such allotment, lease or agreement was granted or entered into before or after the commencement of this Act\".\nThe respondent who was the Custodian of evacuee property granted a lease to the appellants and subsequently issued a notice to them, among other things, calling upon them to show cause why the lease should not be cancelled for committing breaches of the conditions on which the properties had been leased to them.\nThe appellants contended that the respondent had no power to cancel the lease on the ground that under section 12(1) of the Act the power of the Custodian to cancel the lease could be exercised only so as to override a bar imposed by any law but not the contract under which the lease was held and relied on the language of the non obstante clause contained in the section.\nHeld, that the operative portion of the section which confers power on the Custodian to cancel a lease is unqualified and absolute and could not be abridged by reference to the non obstante clause which was only inserted ex abundanti cautela with a view to repel a possible contention that the section does not by implication repeal statutes conferring rights on lessees.\nObservations in Aswini Kumar Ghose vs Arabinda Bose ([1963] S.C.R. 1, 21, 24) and Dominion of India vs Shrinbai A.

his wife Hirabai who is the plaintiff, two sons Gurupad and Shivapad, who are defendants 1 and 2 respectively, and three daughters, defendants 3 to 5.\nOn November 6, 1962 Hirabai filed special civil suit No. 26 of 1963 in the court of the Joint Civil Judge, Senior Division, Sangli for partition and separate possession of a 7/24th share in two houses, a land, two shops avoid movables on the basis that these properties belonged to the joint family consisting of her husband, herself and their two sons.\nIf a partition were to take place during Khandappa's lifetime between himself and his two sons, the plaintiff would have got 1/4th share in the joint family properties, the other three getting 1/4th share each.\nKhandappa's 1/4th share would devolve upon his death on six sharers, the plaintiff and her five children, each having a 1/24th share therein.\nAdding 1/4th and 1/24th, the plaintiff claims a 7/24th share in the joint family properties.\nThat, in short, is the plaintiffs case.\nDefendants 2 to 5 admitted the plaintiff's claim, the suit having H been contested by defendant 1, Gurupad, only.\nHe contended that the suit properties did not belong to the joint family, that they were Khandappa's self requisitions and that, on the date of Khandappa's 764 death in 1960 there was no joint family in existence.\nHe alleged that Khandappa had effected a partition of the suit properties between himself and his two sons in December 1952 and December 1954 and that, by a family arrangement dated March 31, 1955 he bad given directions for disposal of the share which was reserved by him for himself in the earlier partitions.\nThere was, therefore, no question of a fresh partition.\nThat, in short, is the case of defendant 1.\nThe trial court by its judgment dated July 13, 1965 rejected defendant 1's case that the properties were Khandappa's self acquisitions and that he had partitioned them during his lifetime.\nUpon that finding the plaintiff.\nbecame indisputably entitled to a share in the joint family properties but, following the judgment of the Bombay High Court in Shiramabai Bhimgonda vs Kalgonda(1) the learned trial judge limited that share to 1/24th, refusing to add 1/4th and 1/24th together.\nAs against that decree, defendant 1 filed first appeal No. 524 of 1966 in the Bombay High Court, while the plaintiff filed cross objections.\nBy a judgment dated March 19, 1975 a Division Bench of the High Court dismissed defendant 1's appeal and allowed the plaintiff's cross objections by holding that the suit properties belonged to the joint family, that there was no prior partition and that the plaintiff is entitled to a 7/24th share.\nDefendant I has filed this appeal against the High Court's judgment by special leave.\nAnother Division Bench of the Bombay High Court in Rangubai Lalji vs Laxman Lalji(2) had already reconsidered and dissented from earlier Division Bench judgment in Shiramabai Bhimgonda(1) In these two cases, the judgment of the Bench was delivered by the same learned Judge, Patel J.\nOn further consideration the learned Judge felt that Shiramabai(1) was not fully argued and was incorrectly decided and that on a true view of law, the widow's share must be ascertained by adding the share to which she is entitled at a notional partition during her husband's life time and the share which she would get in her husband's interest upon his death.\nIn the judgment under appeal, the Division Bench of the High Court, while accepting the conclusions of the learned Judge in Rangubai Lalji (2) re-affirmed that the suit properties belonged to the joint family and that there was no prior partition.\nThe High Court further held that the plaintiff is entitled to a 7/24th share.\nThe point of law involved in this appeal is whether the suit properties belong to the joint family and whether, on the basis of the notional partition, the plaintiff is entitled to a 7/24th share.\nThe High Court, after considering the two cases of Rangubai(1) and Rangubai(2) and the observations of the learned Judge in the first case, held that the suit properties belonged to the joint family and that the plaintiff is entitled to a 7/24th share.\nThe only point of contention is whether the suit properties belong to the joint family.\nOn the facts and circumstances of this case, it is clear that the plaintiff and her five children are the sole beneficiaries of the properties in question.\nThere is no evidence to show that the properties were acquired by Khandappa in his individual capacity.\nThe properties are in the name of the joint family.\nThe plaintiff and her five children are the sole beneficiaries of the properties.\nThere is no evidence to show that the properties were acquired by Khandappa in his individual capacity.\nTherefore, it is clear that the properties belong to the joint family.\nThe High Court's finding that the suit properties belong to the joint family is correct.\nThe High Court further held that the plaintiff is entitled to a 7/24th share.\nThe High Court's finding on the share of the plaintiff is also correct.\nThe High Court's finding that the suit properties belong to the joint family and that the plaintiff is entitled to a 7/24th share is correct.\nOn the basis of the above, the High Court's judgment and order dated March 19, 1975 is correct and the appeal is without merit.\nThe appeal is accordingly dismissed.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by CHANDRACHUD, C.J.\n--- IN RE: KHANDAPPA SANGAPPA MAGDUM HIARBAI vs GURUPAD BIYAWWA BHAGIRATHIBAI DHUNDUBAI

Welfare laws must be so read as to be effective delivery systems of the salutary objects sought to be served by the Legislature and when the beneficiaries are the weaker sections, like destitute women, this spirit of article 15(3) of the Constitution must belight the meaning of the Section.\nThe Constitution is a pervasive omnipresence brooding over the meaning and transforming the values of every measure.\nSo, section 125 and sister clauses must receive a compassionate expansion of sense that the words used permit.\nThe Brief Facts The respondent (husband) married the appellant (wife) as a second wife, way back in 1956, and a few years later had a son by her.\n15 The initial warmth vanished and the jealousies of a triangular situation erupted, marring mutual affection.\nThe respondent divorced the appellant around July 1962.\nA suit relating to a flat in which the husband had housed the wife resulted in a consent decree which also settled the marital disputes.\nFor instance, it recited that this respondent had transferred the suit premises, namely, a flat in Bombay, to the appellant and also the shares of the Cooperative Housing Society which built the flat concerned.\nThere was a reference to mehar money (Rs. 5,000/ and 'iddat'money, Rs. 180/ ) which was also stated to have been adjusted by the compromise terms.\nThere was a clause in the compromise: G \"The plaintiff declares that she has now no claim or right whatsoever against the defendant or against the estate and the properties of the defendant.\n\" And another term in the settlement was that the appellant had by virtue of the compromise become the absolute owner of the flat and various deposits in respect of the said flat made with the cooperative housing society.\n78 For some time there was flickering improvement in the relations between the quondum husband and the quondum wife and they lived together.\nThereafter, again they separated, became entranged.\nThe appellant, finding herself in financial straits and unable to maintain herself, moved the magistrate under section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973, for a monthly allowance for the maintenance of herself and her child.\nShe proceeded on the footing that she was still a wife while the respondent rejected this status and asserted that she was a divorce and therefore ineligible for maintenance.\nThe Magistrate who tried the petition for maintenance held that the appellant was a subsisting wife and awarded monthly maintenance of Rs. 300/ for the son and Rs. 400/ for the mother for their subsistence, taking due note of the fact that the cost of living in Bombay, where the parties lived, was high, and that the respondent had provided residential accommodation to the appellant.\nThis order was challenged before the sessions Judge by the aggrieved husband, who on a strange view of the law that the court, under section 125, had no jurisdication to consider whether the applicant was a wife, dismissed the petition in allowance of the appeal.\nThe High Court deigned to bestow little attention on the matter and summarily dismissed a revision petition.\nThis protracted and fluctuating litigation misfortune has leu to the appeal, by special leave, before this Court.\nThe Questions Mooted Shri Bhandare appearing for the appellant contended that the Courts below had surprisingly forgotten the plain provision in the Explanation (b) to section 125(1) of the Code, which reads: \"wife'includes a woman who has been divorced by.\nor has obtained a divorce from, her husband and has not remarried.\nOn this foundation, he urged that accepting the contention of the respondent that the appellant was a divorcee? his client was still entitled to an allowance.\nThis is obviously beyond dispute or.\na simple reading of the sub section and it is curious how this innovative and sensitive provision with a benignant disposition towards destitute divorcees has been overlooked by all the courts below.\nWe hold that every divorce otherwise eligible, is entitled to the benefit of maintenance allowance and the dissolution of the marriage makes no difference to this right under the current Code.\nIn the normal course, an order for maintenance must follow, by a process of adjudication and consideration of material facts.\nHere, however, the respondent's contention that the appellant was no longer a wife under the Code, has not the slightest bearing on the entitlement to maintenance.\nThe respondent's assertion that the Code, in the hands of the judiciary, has been misinterpreted and abused has not borne any semblance of truth.\nIn our considered opinion, the respondent's apprehension that the courts below would interpret section 125 in an extravagant manner, has not been justified.\nThe provisions of the Code have been crafted with a view to provide succour to those who are in distress and destitute, as was the intent of the Legislature.\nIn the instant case, the respondent's apprehension that the courts below would allow the wife to claim maintenance as a divorced woman, when she had not remarried, was unfounded.\nThe Courts below have not gone astray.\nIn fact, they have adhered to the interpretation of section 125 as being quite benign and accommodating.\nThe Courts below have simply failed to take into account the provisions of section 125 and the Explanation thereto, and have therefore failed to appreciate the real nature of the provision.\n79\nThe appeal must therefore be allowed, as the Courts below have been grossly wrong in their interpretation of section 125.\nThe Appeal is allowed.\nThe Respondent is directed to pay to the Appellant, from the date of the order of the Magistrate, Rs. 400/- per month for her maintenance.\nThe Appellant will be paid Rs. 300/- per month for the maintenance of the son.\nThe Respondent will also pay the cost of the appeal, if any.\nIt is, however, clear that the respondent cannot wriggle out of the liability by taking the argument that the maintenance order was passed under the Criminal Procedure Code and not under the Hindu Marriage Act.\nThe provision under section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code is designed to provide for maintenance to a destitute woman, regardless of the law under which the marriage has been dissolved.\nTherefore, the respondent must pay the maintenance for the period for which it was ordered by the Magistrate.\nThe appeal is allowed and the respondent is directed to pay the maintenance as above. (emphasized by the Court)\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered on 5th November, 1977.\nM. C. Bhandare, A. N. Karkhanis, Miss Malini Panduval and Mrs. section Bhandare for the Appellant.\nG\nActual: Explanation (b) to section 125(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 provides that \"wife\" includes a woman who has been divorced by or has obtained a divorce from her husband and has not re married.\nSection 127(3) (b) provides that where any order has been made under section 125 in favour of a woman who has been divorced by or has obtained a divorce from her husband, the Magistrate shall if he is satisfied that the woman has been divorced by her husband and has received, whether before or after the date of the said order, the whole of the sum which under any customary or personal law applicable to the parties, was payable on such divorce cancel such order in the circumstances stated therein.\nThe respondent (husband) married the appellant (wife) and had a son by her.\nA few years later the respondent divorced his wife.\nBy a consent decree, in the suit filed by the wife, he transferred to her the flat in which she was living and agreed to pay mehar money.\nThe compromise stated that the \"plaintiff declares that she has now no claim or right whatsoever against the defendant\".\nFor some time thereafter they lived together but again separated.\nThe wife moved the magistrate under section 125 Cr.P. for grant of maintenance to her and her son.\nThis was granted.\nOn appeal the Sessions Judge held mat the Court had no jurisdiction under section 125.\nThe High Court dismissed the wife's appeal.\nOn further appeal to this Court it was contended on behalf of the respondent that (i) section 125(4) would apply in the absence of proof that the wife was not living separately by mutual consent; (ii) to attract section 125 there must be proof of neglect to maintain the wife and (iii) no claim for maintenance in this case can survive in the face of the consent decree whereby mehar money had been paid and all claims adjusted.\nAllowing the appeal the Court, G ^ HELD: Every divorcee, otherwise eligible, is entitled to the benefit of maintenance allowance and the dissolution of the marriage makes no difference to this right under the current Code.\n[78H] 1.\nThere is no force in the argument that the absence of mutual consent to live separately must be made out if the hurdle of section 125(4) is to be overcome.\nThe compulsive conclusion from a divorce by a husband and his provision of a separate residence as evidenced by the consent decree fills the bill.\nDivorce plainfully implies that the\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInput: : Criminal Appeal No 133 of 1975.\nAppeal from the Judgment and order dated 3 2 1978 of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Crl.\nA.

this Court has consistently recognised the right of the appellate court to review the entire evidence and to come to its own conclusion bearing in mind the considerations mentioned by the Privy Council in Sheo Swarup vs Emperor (61 T.A. 389).\nOccasionally phrases like \"manifestly illegal\", \"grossly unjust have been used to describe the orders of acquittal which warrant interference.\nBut such expressions have been used more as flourishes of language to emphasise the reluctance of the appellate court to interfere with an order of acquittal than to curtail the power of the appellate court to review the entire evidence and to come to its own conclusion.\nIn two other cases it has been held that to the principles laid down in Sanwat Singh's case may added the further principle that if two 364 reasonable conclusions could be reached on the basis of the evidence on record the appellate court should not disturb the finding of the trial court.\nThis principle stems out of the fundamental principle of our criminal jurisprudence that the accused is entitled to the benefit of any reasonable doubt.\nIf two reasonably probable and evenly balanced\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInput: Civil Appeal Nos.\n1617 and 1640A of 1979.\nAppeals by Special Leave from the Judgment and order dated 20 1 1979 of the Madhya Pradesh High Court in Misc.\nPetition No 884 of 1978.\nR.

C. Mishra (Petitioner No. 3 in the petition before the High Court) also filed separate petitions for special leave to appeal to this Court.\nAll the petitions for special leave to appeal to this Court were allowed on the ground that there was a serious irregularity in the holding of the election by reason of the fact that the names of the petitioners who were included in the electoral roll, were

1978, in view of the interim order made by the High Court, which was not justified.\nThe question raised in the appeal is whether the High Court was justified in dismissing the petition and the interim order issued by it on the grounds that the election had been held in accordance with the rules and the Act and that the declaration of the results of the election had not been quashed.\nThe question is further complicated by the fact that the High Court had issued a direction to the respondents to prepare the electoral roll afresh in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the

this mandatory requirement, the entire election process held on the basis of the defective electoral roll, became a nullity and therefore the declaration of results of the successful candidates was

Lawrence Joachim Joseph DeSouza, Criminal Application No. 726 of 1955, has held that the order of detention is valid and the grounds of detention are proper.\nThe High Court has also rejected the claim of mala fides on the part of the detaining authority.\nThe grounds of detention, in our opinion, are proper and not vague.\nThe Government of Bombay has not been found to be in mala fide.\nTherefore, the judgment and order of the High Court, dismissing the Criminal Application No. 726 of 1955, is valid and correct.\nAccordingly, the appeal by special leave fails and is dismissed. (See also State of West Bengal v. Ananda Mohan Bose, A.I.R. 1955 S.C. 206 and State of Kerala v. A. K. Gopalan, A.I.R. 1950 S.C. 129).\"\nIn this case, the High Court of Bombay has found that the grounds of detention are proper and not vague, and that the detaining authority was not in mala fide. The grounds of detention are set out in the judgment as follows:\n\"The grounds of detention are as follows:\n\"(i) The detaining authority is of the opinion that the detention is necessary for the reasons that the detenu has been involved in activities prejudicial to the relations of India with the Portuguese Government and for the security of India.\n(ii) The detaining authority is of the opinion that the detenu has been involved in activities which are prejudicial to the security of India.\n(iii) The detaining authority is of the opinion that the detenu has been involved in activities prejudicial to the relations of India with the Portuguese Government.\n(iv) The detaining authority is of the opinion that the detenu has been involved in activities which are prejudicial to the relations of India with the Portuguese Government and for the security of India.\n\nActual: Appellant was detained under section 3(1)(a)(i) of the Preventive Detention Act, Act IV of 1950 on the grounds that with the financial help given by the Portuguese authorities he was carrying on espionage on their behalf with the help of underground workers and that he was also collecting intelligence about the security arrangements on the border area and was making such intelligence available to the Portuguese authorities.\nAppellant made no application to the Government for further particulars.\nHeld, that in these circumstances and having regard to the fact that what is alleged is espionage activity, the grounds could not be considered to be vague.\nIn answer to the objection in the writ application before the High Court that the grounds were not specific and that no particular of the alleged activities of the appellant were given the Under Secretary to the Government in his affidavit claimed privilege under article 22(6) of the Constitution.\nHeld, that the right of the detenue to be furnished particulars is subject to the limitation under article 22(6).\nHence even if the grounds are vague due to the reason that facts cannot be disclosed in the public interest, the order of detention cannot be challenged on the ground of such vagueness.\nThe necessity of communicating the decision to claim privilege under article 22(6) would arise only when the detenue asks for parti 383 culars.\nIn the absence of any such request by the detenue, the noncommunication of the decision cannot be hold to have hampered his constitutional right to make his representation.\nMala fides must be made out against the detaining authority and not against the police.\nThe contention of mala fides is untenable in the present case having regard to the nature of the grounds and to the nature of the activities imputed to the appellant.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInput: Civil Appeals Nos. 2299 and 2300 of 1979.\nAppeal by Special Leave from the Award dated 20 12 1978 of the Industrial Tribunal Maharashtra in Reference (IT) No. 292 of 1975, published in Maharashtra Government Gazette dated 15th February, 1979.\nG.

T. No. 292 of 1975.\n170 The Union filed a statement before the Tribunal claiming an upward revision of the wage scales and dearness allowance and an increase from fifteen years to twenty years in the span for earning annual increments.\nIt was urged that the Efficiency Bar, as a feature of the wage scales, should be removed.\nThe dearness allowance, it was claimed, should be granted on a slab system.\nThe claim of the Union was resisted by the appellant, who maintained that the existing wage scales were fair and reasonable on a region cum industry basis and that it would not be possible for the appellant to bear the additional financial burden if the demands of the Union were accepted.\nReference was made to the political uncertainty in Iran which had placed an appreciable part of the appellant's business in jeopardy and to various other factors, peculiar to an engineering consultancy business, beyond the appellant's control.\nThere was fierce competition also, it was asserted, from other similar organisations.\nThe appellant had introduced various pay scales in 1973 and some time later they were revised.\nThere was no separate dearness allowance until January, 1977 when it was introduced for the first time.\nHouse rent allowance was also paid.\nDearness allowance became payable at 10% of the basic wage subject to a minimum of Rs. 50/ and house rent allowance at 30% of the basic salary.\nNothing those facts, the Tribunal observed that compared with the increased paying capacity of the appellant, an inference drawn from the prosperity enjoyed by the appellant over the years, there was definite need for revising the wage scales.\nIt was pointed out that the dearness allowance and house rent allowance granted by the appellant made little impact in neutralising the cost of living.\nThe need for revising the wage scales was not disputed by the appellant.\nIn proceeding to revise the wage structure the Tribunal took into account the two principles involved in the process, the financial capacity of the industry to bear the burden of an increased wage bill, and the prevailing wage structure on an industry cum region basis.\nWage scale statements were filed by the parties before the Tribunal pertaining to several engineering consultancy organisations but in the absence of pertinent information concerning the strength of their labour force, the extent of their business, the financial position for some years, the capital invested, the precise nature of the business, the position regarding reserves, dividends declared and future prospects of the company, the Tribunal found that it was unable to rely on them as comparable concerns.\nHolding it impossible in the circumstances to apply the principle of industry cum region basis, the Tribunal turned to a consideration of the financial capacity of the company to bear an additional burden.\n171 in this connection, it proceeded on the footing that the appellant was a separate and independent division of Tata Sons Limited and had no \"functional integrality\" with the other divisions.\nHaving regard to the net profits earned by the appellant from 1968 to 1977 it found that the acceptance of the demands of the Union would result in an increased burden of Rs. 7 crores and 25 lakhs on the appellant.\nThe Tribunal thus concluded that the wage scales were revised upwards, but the wage scales were reduced by 25% and the dearness allowance was also reduced by 20%.\nThe Tribunal then proceeded to compute the benefit to the workmen by estimating the increase in the wage scales and the dearness allowance and found that the net benefit to the workmen was Rs. 1, 34, 000.\nIt was observed by the Tribunal that this was a modest increase and that the burden placed upon the industry would be significant.\nThe Tribunal, however, was not satisfied with the explanation provided by the appellant as to why the wage scales had been revised upwards in the year 1973.\nThe Tribunal observed that it would be unreasonable to expect the industry to absorb the increased wage bill without a corresponding increase in the remuneration of the managerial personnel.\nIt was, therefore, decided to reduce the wage scales by 25% to bring them in line with the remuneration of the managerial personnel.\nIt was also observed that the wage scales had been revised upwards in the year 1973 and that the dearness allowance had been introduced in January 1977.\nThe Tribunal, however, observed that the wage scales had not kept pace with the cost of living and that the dearness allowance, as granted, did not have a significant impact on the cost of living.\nIt was, therefore, decided to revise the wage scales upwards, reduce the wage scales by 25% to bring them in line with the remuneration of the managerial personnel and also to revise the dearness allowance on a slab system.\nThe Tribunal thus, on 20th December, 1978, passed an award which was dated 20th December, 1978, revising the wage scales upwards, reducing the wage scales by 25% to bring them in line with the remuneration of the managerial personnel and revising the dearness allowance on a slab system.\nThe Tribunal, however, observed that the wage scales had not kept pace with the cost of living and that the dearness allowance, as granted, did not have a significant impact on the appellant's cost of living.\nIt was, therefore, decided to revise the wage scales upwards, reduce the wage scales by 25% to bring them in line with the remuneration of the managerial personnel and also to revise the dearness allowance on a slab system.\nThe Tribunal thus, on 20th December, 1978, passed an award which was dated\nActual: Dismissing the appeals by special leave, the Court. ^ HELD: Per Pathak, J. (Krishna Iyer and Chinnappa Reddy, JJ.\nconcurring) (1) Having regard to the financial capacity of M/s. Tata Consulting Engineers, the appellant, and the material on the record and the various other considerations which prevailed with the Tribunal, the granting of revised wage scales is in order.\nAlthough the wage scales were introduced as long ago as 1973 they were maintained at that level except for a slight revision some time thereafter.\nNo dearness allowance was paid until the beginning of 1977 and the house rent allowance also was introduced about that time.\nThe cost of living had gone on increasing from 1972 onwards and the dearness allowance and house rent allowances made no appreciable impact in neutralising the increasing cost.\nDuring all these years, the appellant had continued to enjoy increasing profits; nonetheless the emoluments received by the workmen did not receive the impress of the appellant's growing prosperity.\nThe Charter of Demands was presented by the Union in July, 1974 and when conciliation proceedings failed the State Government made a reference to the Industrial Tribunal in 1975.\nThe several considerations which prevailed with the Tribunal giving retrospectivity to the revised pay scales and referred to by it cannot be ignored.\n[174C G] (2) It is not a universal rule that the dearness allowance should in all cases be correlated with the cost of living index.\nThe Tribunal, in the present case, considered the matter and found it sufficient and in accord with justice that the wage scales should be restructured with suitable increments provided therein.\nIt noted that dearness allowance was being granted by the appellant at 10% of the salary subject to a minimum of Rs. 50/ and house rent allowance at 30% of the basic salary.\nHaving regard to the not inconsiderable improvement in the level of the basic wage, it observed that there would be a consequent increase in the dearness allowance and house rent allowance.\nIn view of the increase so secured, the Tribunal rejected the suggestion that a slab system should be introduced in the dearness allowance or that there should be any other modification of the principle on which dearness allowance was being presently granted.\nIt declared that the cumulative effect of an im 167 proved wage structure together with dearness allowance operating on a slab system would throw an impossible burden of about Rs. 1 crore on the financial capacity of the appellant.\nIt was open to\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInput: ivil Appeal No. 196 of 1 970.\nFrom the judgment and decree dated April 21, 1969 of the Allahabad High Court in First Appeal No. 80 of 1964.\nS.T.

Leelavati Shankar Ayyar, the members of the Sanyasi sect were entitled to own and possess personal property.\nIt was observed in the case of Mani Shankar Ayyar vs Smt Leelavati Shankar Ayyar that the members of the Sanyasi sect, including the Mahants, could own and possess personal property and that the provisions of the Sanyas Vidhi and the Dasnami Sanyasi sect did not prohibit the ownership of personal property by the members.\nIt was observed in the case of Mani Shankar Ayyar vs Smt. Leelavati Shankar Ayyar that the provisions of the Sanyas Vidhi did not prohibit the members of the sect from owning and possessing personal property.\nIn the case of Sushil Chandra Sen vs Ganga Chandra Chowdhury, it was observed that the Dashnami Sanyasi sect had its own rules, which permitted the members, including Mahants, to own and possess personal property.\nIn the case of Mani Shankar Ayyar vs Smt. Leelavati Shankar Ayyar, it was observed that the Sanyasi sect had its own rules, which permitted the members, including Mahants, to own and possess personal property.\nThe Supreme Court in the case of Mani Shankar Ayyar vs Smt. Leelavati Shankar Ayyar observed that the members of the Sanyasi sect were permitted to own and possess personal property.\nThe Supreme Court in the case of Sushil Chandra Sen vs Ganga Chandra Chowdhury observed that the Dashnami Sanyasi sect permitted its members, including Mahants, to own and possess personal property.\nIn the case of Ram Nath vs Shri Ram Charan, the Supreme Court observed that the Dashnami Sanyasi sect permitted its members, including Mahants, to own and possess personal property.\nThe Supreme Court in the case of Sardar Bahadur Singh vs Smt.

The appellant, Bharat Aluminium Company Ltd., is a Government Company incorporated under the, the entire share capital being owned by the Government of India.\nRespondent 1, the Special Area Development Authority for the Korba Special Area, is constituted under section 65 of the Madhya Pradesh Nagar Tatha Gram Nivesh Adhiniyam (23 of 1973), referred to hereinafter as 'the Act of 1973 '.\nThat Act was passed by the Madhya Pradesh Legislature in order \"to make provision for planning and development and use of land; to make better provision for the preparation of development plans and zoning plans with a view to ensuring that town planning schemes are made in a proper manner and their execution is made effective; to constitute Town 7 and Country Planning Authority for proper implementation of town and country development plan; to provide for the development and administration of special areas through Special Area Development Authority; to make provision for the compulsory acquisition of land required for the purpose of the development plans and for purposes connected with the matters aforesaid\".\nChapter VIII of the Act, consisting of sections 64 to 71, is entitled \"Special Areas\".\nSection 64 empowers the State Government to declare any area as a special area by issuing a notification.\nSection 55 provides that for every Special Area there shall be a Special Area Development Authority consisting of a Chairman and such other members as the Government may determine from time to time.\nThe Chairman and the members of the Development Authority are appointed by the Government.\nSection 68, which prescribes the functions of the Development Authority, lays down by clauses (v) and (vi) that the Development Authority shall make provision for the municipal services and municipal management of the Special Area.\nSection 69, by clauses (c) and (d), confers upon the Development Authority powers for the purpose of municipal administration and for the purpose of taxation.\nThese two clauses of section 69 and clauses (v) and (vi) of section 68 were inserted in their present shape by Ordinance 26 of 1975 which came into force on February 27, 1976.\nThe Ordinance was replaced by the Madhya Pradesh Nagar Tatha Gram Nivesh (Sanshodhan) Adhiniyam, 1976 (6 of 1976).\nSection 69(d) of the Act of 1973 reads thus: \"69.\nPowers: The Special Area Development Authority shall (d) for the purpose of taxation have the powers which is municipal corporation or a municipal council has, as the case may be, under the Madhya Pradesh Municipal Corporation Act, 1956 (No. 23 of 1956) or the Madhya Pradesh Municipalities Act, 1961 (No. 37 of 1961), (a) where the municipal corporation of municipal council existed in such area prior to its designation as special area under section 64, according to the municipal law by which such special area was governed prior to its designation, or (b) where no such municipal corporation or municipal council existed in such area prior to its designation as special area under section 64, then according to the provisions of the law which was in force in such area prior to its designation as special area.\"\nSection 69(c) of the Act of 1973 reads thus: \"69.\nPowers: The Special Area Development Authority shall (c) for the purpose of municipal administration have such powers as a municipal corporation or a municipal council has, as the case may be, under the Madhya Pradesh Municipal Corporation Act, 1956 (No. 23 of 1956), or the Madhya Pradesh Municipalities Act, 1961 (No. 37 of 1961), (a) where the municipal corporation of municipal council existed in such area prior to its designation as special area under section 64, according to the municipal law by which such special area was governed prior to its designation, or (b) where no such municipal corporation or municipal council existed in such area prior to its designation as special area under section 64, then according to the provisions of the law which was in force in such area prior to its designation as special area\".\nAs a result of the changes brought about by Ordinance 26 of 1975, the Development Authority was given the power to collect property tax, even if there was no existing municipal corporation or municipal council in the area.\nBefore the Ordinance came into force, the Special Area Development Authority was not empowered to collect property tax.\nTherefore, the Bharat Aluminium Company Ltd. and the Western Coalfields Ltd. argued that the power to collect property tax was not vested in the Special Area Development Authority under the Act of 1973.\nThey submitted that the said power was vested in the State Government under section 68 of the Act of 1973.\nThey further submitted that by the said Ordinance, the power to collect property tax was given to the Development Authority, but that such power was not vested in the Development Authority under the provisions of the Act of 1973, prior to the coming into force of the Ordinance.\nTherefore, the Development Authority, under the said Ordinance, had the power to collect property tax, but that power was not vested in the Development Authority under the provisions of the Act of 1973, prior to the coming into force of the Ordinance.\nTherefore, they submitted that the Development Authority had no power to collect property tax and that the power to collect property tax was\nActual: The Madhya Pradesh Municipalities Act, 1961 by section 127 (1) (i) empowered a municipal council to impose, in the whole or any part of the municipality, \"a tax payable by the owners of houses, buildings or lands situated within the limits of Municipality with reference to annual letting value of the house, building or land called property tax\".\nThe corresponding provision in the Madhya Pradesh Municipal Corporation Act, 1956 was section 132(1)(a), and it provided that \"the Corporation shall impose a tax payable by the owners of buildings or lands situated within the city with reference to the gross annual letting value of the building or land called the property tax\".\nThe procedure for imposition of taxes was spelt out in section 129 of the Municipalities Act and section 133 of the Municipal Corporation Act.\nSection 127A was inserted in the Municipalities Act for imposition of property tax and provided by sub clause (1) that as and from the financial year 1976 77 there shall be charged, levied and paid for each financial year a tax on the lands or buildings or both situated in a municipality at specified rates.\nSub clause (2) exempted properties owned by or vesting in the Union Government, State Government or the Council from the levy.\nSimilar 2 provisions were inserted in sections 135 and 136 of the Municipal Corporation Act.\nRespondent No. 1 was constituted the Special Area Development Authority under section 65 of the Madhya Pradesh Nagar Tatha Gram Nivesh Adhiniyam (23 of 1973).\nClauses (c) and (d) of section 69 of the Act conferred upon the Development Authority powers for the purpose of municipal administration and for the purpose of taxation.\nThese clauses were inserted by Ordinance 26 of 1975 which came into force on February 27, 1976.\nThe Ordinance was replaced by the Madhya Pradesh Nagar Tatha Gram Nivesh (Sanshodhan) Adhiniyam 1976 (6 of 1976).\nOn June 24, 1976 respondent 1 entered into an agreement with the appellant company under which the company agreed to contribute a sum of rupees 3 lakhs annually to the \"seed capital\" of the Authority in consideration of the Authority agreeing not to exercise its power of taxation or of levying any other charges on the assets and activities of the company.\nThe agreement was to remain in force for a period of ten years beginning from the calendar\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInput: Civil Appeal No. 598 of 1980.\nAppeal by Special leave from

(herein after referred to as the Act) for permission to construct a modern Cinema Hall at the proposed site, a detailed description of which was furnished in the plan annexed to the application.\nShri Ved Gupta was informed by the District Magistrate, Jammu by his Memo (Annexure B) that the Government had approved the construction of a Cinema Hall at the proposed site and had granted the requisite permission in his favour as per letter dated September 11, 1967, issued by the Secretary to Government, General Department.\nFrom Annexure B, it would appear that the permission so granted was in favour of Ved Ved Gupta in his individual capacity and not as the representative of any firm.\nIn the meantime, by a deed dated December 7, 1966, which was registered on December 24, 1966, the plot in question was taken on lease jointly by Ved Gupta, Todar Mal and Krishan Kumar for a period of 40 years on the terms and conditions set out therein.\nThereafter, under a deed dated July 15, 1969, the aforesaid three persons entered into a partnership along with 11 others under the name and style \"Metro Theatres\" for carrying on the business of constructing and running a modern air conditioned Cinema in the site covered by the permission granted by the Government.\nClause 15 of the said deed provided that the site for construction of a Cinema which had been obtained on lease by Ved Gupta, Todar Mal and Krishan Kumar in their own names shall not be their personal property, but shall be the property of the partnership, and that the permission which Ved Gupta had obtained from the Government for construction of the Theatre in the said plot shall be treated as the property of the partnership.\nBy a subsequent agreement executed by the 14 partners on February 22, 1969, the name of the Cinema business was changed from 'Metro Theatre'to 'Apsara Theatre.\n\" The construction of the Cinema Theatre appears to have commenced in 1970 and the building was completed in 1973. The cinema started its operations in 1973 and it was in continuous use for about 9 years. However, on 15-12-1981, the cinema was closed down by the respondent No. 1, the Chief Executive Officer, Jammu and Kashmir Tourism Corporation, under an order dated 15-12-1981, by which the Corporation, by virtue of section 6 of the Act, cancelled the permission granted to the respondent No. 2, the Appellant, under the said Act.\nThe said order was passed after the cinema had been in continuous use for about 9 years and the reason given in the said order was that the cinema was situated in a place of high commercial importance and the same was being used by the Corporation for conducting marriages and other social functions and hence, the cinema was being used against public interest.\nThe Appellant preferred Writ Petition No. 436 of 1980 against the said order and the High Court by its judgment and order dated July 1, 1981 allowed the Writ Petition and set aside the order of the Chief Executive Officer, Jammu and Kashmir Tourism Corporation. The said judgment was passed by a Division Bench of the High Court presided over by the Acting Chief Justice.\nHowever, the Division Bench of the High Court which heard the appeal of the Appellant, dismissed the appeal by the judgment and order dated July 1, 1982. The said judgment was passed by the Division Bench of the High Court presided over by a learned Single Judge, Dr. A. section Anand.\nHence, the Appellant has preferred these two appeals (C.A. No. 2611/81 and C.A. No. 2611 A/81) against the judgment and order of the Division Bench of the High Court dated July 1, 1982.\nThe Appellant has raised the following points in appeal against the said judgment of the Division Bench:-\n(i) The Division Bench of the High Court was not justified in allowing the Writ Petition and setting aside the order of the Chief Executive Officer, Jammu and Kashmir Tourism Corporation, because the cinema was situated in a place of high commercial importance and the same was being used by the Corporation for conducting marriages and other social functions and hence, the cinema was being used against public interest.\n(ii) The Division Bench of the High Court was not justified in allowing the Writ Petition and setting aside\nActual: The appellant, purporting to Act on behalf of a partnership consisting of himself, Todar Mal and Krishan Kumar, applied for and obtained permission in his individual capacity to construct a cinema theatre on a plot of land which was taken on lease jointly by all the three of them after the application for the permission was made but before the same was granted.\nThey entered into a partnership along with 11 others for carrying on the business of constructing and running a cinema theatre and the deed of partnership contained a clause that the plot of land as well as the permission obtained for constructing the theatre shall be the property of the firm.\nOn completion of the construction the appellant applied for, in his own name, and obtained in his personal capacity, a licence to exhibit cinematograph films at the Theatre.\nThe partnership was re constituted on retirement of two partners and the new deed executed by the remaining partners also contained a clause that the firm shall have the right to operate the licence.\nAn application for inclusion of the names of Todar Mal and Krishan Kumar in the licence was rejected by an order of the Licensing Authority who held that the appellant was the sole licensee and the said order became final.\nAnother application for renewal of the licence in the name of the Theatre on the ground that the appellant had been expelled from the partnership was also rejected by an order of the Licensing Authority which was not challenged.\nThereafter when, in a suit instituted for a declaration that the licence was the property of the firm, the trial court issued an injunction restraining the appellant from interfering with the possession and running of the Theatre by some of the partners of the firm, the appellant wrote to the Licensing Authority disclaiming responsibility for any acts of commission or omission committed by others in the premises of the Theatre.\nThe Licensing Authority, acting on a report from the police that films were being exhibited in the Theatre by persons other than the licensee, ordered suspension of exhibition of films at the Theatre.\nA writ petition challenging the validity of this order filed in the name of the Theatre was dismissed by a Single Judge of the High Court.\nIn tho Letters Patent Appeal heard by a Division Bench consisting of the Acting Chief Justice another Judge of the High Court the Acting Chief Justice held that the impugned order was void but the other Judge agreed with the view of the Single Judge who had dismissed the petition earlier.\nIn view of 576 the divergence of opinion, the matter was referred to the only other Judge available in the High Court, but he having declined to hear the same for good reason, the Division Bench decided under\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInput: ivil appeal No. 2197 From the Judgment and order dated 16.4.70 of Andhra Pradesh High Court in appeal No. 431 of 1965.\nDr. YS Chitale, V.

Sambasiva Rao, Approved Medical practitioner of the appellant in regard to the medical examination of the deceased.\nA report described as \"All the Friend's report\" was duly sent to the appellant with regard to that proposal; and all the preliminaries were completed and it was further alleged that the deceased was assured and told by the local agent and the Field officer of the Corporation that the payment of the first premium would amount to the acceptance of the proposal and advised the deceased to pay the first premium in full.\nIt was, further, stated that the said two cheques were encashed and the appellant had duly appropriated the amount and credited in the accounts towards the premium payable by the deceased.\nTherefore, it was stated that the deceased had fulfilled his part of the insurance contract and the appellant Corporation by its overt acts of encashing the cheques and crediting the amounts in its accounts accepted the proposal of the deceased.\nIn the premises it was said in the plaint that there was a concluded and valid insurance contract between the deceased and the appellant Corporation and that the insurance contracted commenced on 11th January, 1961 being the date of the receipt of the balance towards premium by the Corporation.\nIt was further stated in the plaint that the office of the Divisional Manager of Masulipatam was the concerned authority to settle the claim of the plaintiffs respondents and to pay the amount.\nThe contention of the Corporation that the proposal was not accepted and as such there was no concluded insurance contract between the deceased and the Corporation, was untenable, according to the plaintiffs.\nIt was alleged that with full knowledge of the completion of the proposal, the Corporation had accepted the proposal and had proceeded to encash the two cheques for the first premium in full, and therefore, the Corporation was liable to pay the amount of Rs. 50,000 to the plaintiffs respondents.\nThe Subordinate Judge, Masulipatam, after considering the evidence on record, held that the proposal was not accepted by the deceased, and that the Corporation had not accepted the proposal and that there was no insurance contract between the deceased and the Corporation.\nThe Subordinate Judge, Masulipatam, therefore, dismissed the suit of the plaintiffs respondents.\nThe respondents appealed to the High Court of Andhra Pradesh, by a revision petition, which was allowed by the High Court, by a Judgment and order dated 16th April, 1970.\nThe High Court of Andhra Pradesh, on the basis of the evidence on record, held that the insurance contract was valid and was accepted by the Corporation.\nThe High Court of Andhra Pradesh, after careful consideration of the evidence on record, held that the two cheques for the first premium were not merely a payment of the premium but were a part of the proposal, and that the proposal was accepted by the Corporation.\nThe High Court of Andhra Pradesh, therefore, held that the insurance contract was valid and the Corporation was liable to pay the amount of Rs. 50,000 to the plaintiffs respondents.\nThe High Court of Andhra Pradesh, accordingly, reversed the Judgment and order of the Subordinate Judge, Masulipatam.\nThe case is to be decided in this Court on the basis of the appeal filed by the Corporation against the Judgment and order of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh.\nIt is not necessary to reproduce the entire judgment and order of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh in this Court.\nThe main contention of the Corporation is that the proposal was not accepted by the deceased and that there was no insurance contract between the deceased and the Corporation.\nIt is contended that the two cheques for the first premium were merely a payment of the premium and not a part of the proposal.\nIt is, therefore, contended that the insurance contract was not concluded and was not accepted by the Corporation.\nThe main contention of the respondents is that the proposal was accepted by the Corporation and that there was a concluded and valid insurance contract between the deceased and the Corporation.\nThe two cheques for the first premium were, therefore, not merely a payment of the premium, but a part of the proposal.\nIt is, therefore,\nActual: One Late Raja Vasireddi Chandra Dhara Prasad died intestate on 12th January, 1961.\nHe had filled a proposal for insurance for Rs. 50,000 on 27th December 1960.\nThere was medical examination by the doctor on the life of the deceased on 27th, December, 1960.\nThe deceased issued two cheques being the consideration towards the first premium for Rs 300 and Rs. 220 respectively which were encashed by the appellant on 29th December 1960 and 11th January 1961.\nOn 16th January 1961, the widow of the deceased wrote to the appellant intimating the death of the deceased and demanded payment of Rs. 50,000 The Divisional Manager, Masulipatam Branch denied liability on behalf of the appellant on 28th January, 1961.\nThereafter there was correspondence between the parties between Ist February 1961 and 23rd December 1963.\nOn 10th January 1964, the respondents filed a suit in the Court of Subordinate Judge, Masulipatam.\nThe trial court dismissed the suit holding, inter alia, that there was no concluded contract, that the proposal was not accepted by the Divisional Manager for some reason or the other by the time the deceased had died, that neither the encashment of the two cheques created a contract of insurance.\nIn appeal, the High Court after ordering certain other additional documents set aside the Trial Court Judgment.\nHence the appeal by the Corporation after obtaining the special leave.\nAllowing the appeal, the Court ^ HELD; 1.\nHaving regard to the clear position in law about acceptance of insurance proposal and the evidence of record in this case, it is clear that the, High Court was in error.\nin coming to the conclusion that there was a concluded contract of insurance between the deceased and the Life Insurance Corporation.\n[360D E] 2.\nThough in certain human relationship silence to a proposal might 351 convey acceptance but in the case of insurance proposal, silence does not denote consent and no binding contract arises until the person to whom an offer is made says or does something to signify his acceptance.\nMere delay in giving an answer cannot be construed as an acceptance, as, prima facie, acceptance must be communicated to the offer or The general rule is that the contract of insurance will be concluded only when the party to whom an offer has been made accepts it unconditionally\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInput: Civil Appeal

relevant, that subject to rules made by the Government, a Panchayat Samiti may employ such servants as it may consider necessary for the efficient performance of the duties imposed upon it by the Act, rules or bye laws made thereunder or by.\nany other law for the time being in force.\nIn pursuance of this power, the appellant was appointed as a clerk on June 1, 1963 by the Panchayat Samiti, Loharu, which is respondent 3 in this appeal.\nHe was confirmed in that post in course of time.\nOn January 21, 1974 he was promoted as a Head Clerk on an ad hoc basis.\nOn March 14, 1975 a resolution was passed by respondent 3 regularising the post of Head Clerk.\nOn April 1, 1975, the appellant was appointed as a Head Clerk.\nThe Punjab Panchayat Samitis, Zilla Parishads (Haryana Amendment) Act, 1973 introduced extensive amendments in the Act of 1961.\nSection 13 of the Amending Act deleted section 33 of the Act.\nA plain consequence of this deletion was that the Panchayat Samitis were divested of their power to make appointments to the Panchayats.\nThe Amending Act received the assent of the Governor 736 on April 25, 1973 and was published in the Haryana Gazette on June 13, 1973.\nSections 35(1) of the Act empowers the State Government to place at the disposal of a Panchayat Samiti such of its servants as are required for the implementation of the schemes connected therewith and for such other duties and functions as may be assigned to them by the Panchayat Samiti from time to time.\nSection 35(3) which dealt with the conditions of service of the Government servants allotted to the Panchayat Samitis, was amended by section 14 of the Amending Act of 1973.\nSub section (4) of section 14 of the Amending Act provides that persons employed by a Panchayat Samiti before April 1, 1973 and who were in service at the commencement of the Amending Act shall continue to service on the same terms and conditions on which they were employed by the Panchayat Samiti\", until they are absorbed in the Government service or retire in such manner as may be prescribed.\nActing in pursuance of the provision of section 14(4) of the Amending Act, the Government of Haryana notified the absorption of the appellant as a clerk though, as stated earlier he was working as a head Clerk in the Loharu Panchayat Samiti.\nBeing aggrieved by his absorption on a lower post, he filed a writ petition in the High Court of Punjab and Haryana, asking that he should be absorbed as a Head Clerk.\nThe writ petition having been dismissed by the High Court, the appellant has filed this appeal by special leave.\nThe appellant was appointed as a clerk by the Loharu Panchayat Samiti in 1963, long before the Amending Act came into force on June 13, 1973.\nHe was, therefore, entitled to be absorbed in Government service as a clerk in any event.\nBut, as a result of the deletion of section 33 of the Act by the Amending Act of 1973, the Panchayat Samiti lost its power to make appointments to the Panchayat.\nThe fact that the appellant was promoted as a Head Clerk on an ad hoc basis in January 1974, or the further fact that he was appointed as a Head Clerk on April 1, 1975, cannot improve his position for the simple reason that these appointments were made after June 13, 1973, being the date on which the Panchayat Samiti lost its power to make appointments to.\nthe Panchayat.\n737 It is urged by Shri Jain who appears on behalf of the appellant that by reason of section 14(4) of the Amending Act, the appellant was entitled to continue in the service of the Panchayat on the same terms and conditions on which he was employed by the Panchayat Samiti until he was absorbed in the Government service or retired.\nHowever, as we shall see later, this argument is not tenable.\nThe only issue in this appeal is whether the appellant was entitled to be absorbed in the Government service as a Head Clerk on the same terms and conditions on which he was employed by the Panchayat Samiti.\nIn our opinion, this issue is answered by the fact that the Panchayat Samiti lost its power to make appointments to the Panchayat by reason of the deletion of section 33 of the Act by the Amending Act of 1973.\nThe Panchayat Samiti having lost its power to make appointments to the Panchayat, it could not have made the appointments of the appellant as a Head Clerk on April 1, 1975.\nThe fact that the Government of Haryana had notified the absorption of the appellant as a clerk in the Government service by reason of section 14(4) of the Amending Act does not, in our opinion, improve the position of the appellant.\nSection 14(4) provides that persons employed by a Panchayat Samiti before April 1, 1973 and who were in service at the commencement of the Amending Act shall continue to service on the same terms and conditions on which they were employed by the Panchayat Samiti until they are absorbed in the Government service or retire in such manner as may be prescribed.\nHowever, this provision does not apply to the situation where the Panchayat Samiti has lost its power to make appointments to the Panchayat.\nThe fact that the appellant was employed by the Panchayat Samiti as a Head Clerk before April 1, 1973, is, in our opinion, irrelevant in view of the fact that the Panchayat Samiti had lost its power to make appointments to the Panchayat by reason of the deletion of section 33 of the Act by the Amending Act of 1973.\nWe are, therefore, of the opinion that the appellant was not entitled to be absorbed in the Government service as a Head Clerk on the same terms and conditions on which he was employed by the Panchayat Samiti.\nThe judgment and order of the High Court in dismissing the writ petition of the appellant is, therefore, correct and the appeal is without merit.\nThe appeal is dismissed.

The High Court acquitted accused 1 to 4 and set aside the conviction and the sentence awarded to accused 5 and 7 on the ground that the conspiracy alleged in the charge under section 120B I.P.C. is not a valid one.\nThe High Court has held that there is no concrete evidence to prove that the accused 1, 2, 3 and 4 were ever in touch with each other at any point of time prior to the commission of the crime and that the approver Sheshrao (P.W. 1) had fabricated the story of conspiracy.\nThe High Court, therefore, held that the conspiracy alleged in the charge under section 120B I.P.C. was not proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\nThe High Court acquitted accused 1 to 4 on the ground that the evidence of the approver Sheshrao (P.W. 1) is not sufficient to prove the conspiracy alleged in the charge under section 120B I.P.C.\nThe High Court, therefore, acquitted accused 1 to 4 and set aside the conviction and the sentence awarded to accused 5 and 7.\nNow, the State of Maharashtra filed Criminal Appeal 38 of 1977 for enhancement of the sentence of imprisonment for life awarded to accused 1 and 6 by the trial court.\nThe State of Maharashtra also filed Criminal Appeal 605 of 1978 for enhancement of the sentence of imprisonment for life awarded to accused 1 and 6 by the trial court.\nNow, Vinayak, accused 6, has filed an appeal against the conviction of accused 6 and the sentence of imprisonment for\nActual: In Sessions Case No. 26 of 1976, seven accused namely Sitarama @ Sitya, Sundera @ Sundarayya, Kishana @ Kishanayya, Gangarama @ Gangayya, Prakash, Vinayak and Shrirang were charged and tried together for offences under section 302 read with section 120B and also under section 302 read with section 34 I.P.C. Charge No. 1 was for criminal conspiracy under section 302 read with section 120B I.P.C. on the allegation that between first week of October, 1975 and 2nd January, 1976 at Babultara and Waghala villages all the seven accused and the approver P.W. 1 entered into a criminal conspiracy to commit murders of young girls and women in the vicinity of Babultara village by injuring the victims or disfiguring their faces in order to make it appear that the accused in an earlier case called the Manwath murders case where 10 girls and women were murdered during the period from 14.11.1972 to 4.11.1974 in Manwath village were not the real culprits.\nCharges 2 to 4 were framed under section 302 read with section 34 I.P.C. alleging that in furtherance of their common intention, accused 1 to 3 committed the murder of Ashamati on or about 10th November, 1975, accused 1 to 4 committed the murder of Parubai on or about 29th November, 1975 and accused 1, 6 and 7 committed the murder of Malan on or about 1st January, 1976.\nThe Sessions Judge on a consideration of the evidence acquitted all the seven accused under charge No. 1; all the accused under charges 2 and 3 and accused 7 under charge No. 4, but convicted accused 1 and 6 under charge No. 4 and sentenced them to undergo imprisonment for life under section 302 read with section 34 I.P.C. Aggrieved by the conviction and sentence accused 1 and 6 filed Criminal Appeal No. 7 of 1977 in the High Court of Bombay, while the State preferred Criminal Appeal No. 38 of 1977 for enhancement of the sentence awarded to them under section 377 Cr.\nThe State also preferred under section 378 Cr.\nP.C.

J.\nIn the elections held to the Legislative Assembly of Andhra Pradesh in January 1983, a new political party called Telugu Desam was swept to power.\nIt assumed office on January 9, 1983.\nOn February 8, 1983 an Order (G.O. Ms. No. 36) was issued by the Government of Andhra Pradesh stating that it had decided to reduce the age of superannuation of all Government employees, other than in the last Grade Service, from 58 to 58 years.\nTwo notifications issued in exercise of the power conferred 586 by the Proviso to Article 309 read with Article 313 of the Constitution was appended to that order.\nThe relevant Fundamental Rules were amended by the first notification, while the corresponding rules of the Hyderabad Civil Services Rules were amended by the second notification.\nBy these notifications, every Government servant, whether ministerial or non ministerial but not belonging to the last Grade Service, who had already attained the age of 55 years was to retire from service with effect from February 28, 1983.\nSpeaking to the Government employees in the Secretariat premises the next day, the Chief Minister justified the reduction of the retirement age from 58 to 55 years on the ground that it had become necessary to provide greater employment opportunities to the youths.\nOver 18,000 Government employees and 10,000 public sector employees were superannuated as a result of the order.\nThese writ petitions were filed by the Andhra Pradesh Government employees to challenge the aforesaid order and the notifications on the ground that they violate Articles 14, 16, 21 and 300A of the Constitution.\nThe case of the petitioners as laid in the writ petitions is that there was no basis at all for reducing the age of retirement from 58 to 55; that the age of retirement was increased from 55 to 58 by the Government of Andhra Pradesh by a notification dated October 29, 1979 and nothing had happened since then to justify reduction of the age of retirement again to 5 i; that providing employment opportunities to the youths h Is no relevance on the question of fixing the age of retirement; that the Government had exercised its power arbitrarily without having regard to factors which are relevant on the fixation of the age of retirement; that the Government had acted unreasonably in not giving any previous notice to the employees which would have enabled them to arrange their affairs on the eve of retirement; that the Government was estopped from reducing the age of retirement to 55, since the employees had acted on the representation made to them in 1979 by increasing the age of retirement from 55 to 58; that as a result of the increase in the age of retirement from 55 to 58 years in 1976, a vested right had accrued to the employees, which could be taken away, if at all, only from future entrants to the Government service; that retirement of experienced and mature persons from Government service will result in grave detriment to public services of the State; and that, the decision of the Government is bad for being arbitrary, unreasonable and violative of fundamental rights of the petitioners.\nThe respondents have contended that the Government had the power to reduce the age of retirement from 58 to 55 years and that the decision to reduce the age of retirement was taken in good faith and in the interest of the state.\nIt is contended by the respondents that the power to fix the age of retirement is vested in the State and that it is not open to judicial review. The power to fix the age of retirement is vested in the State by virtue of Article 309 of the Constitution. According to Article 309 (1) of the Constitution, the State shall, by law, make provision for the establishment of a Civil Service of the Indian Union, and all other civil services and posts in the Union, and for the recruitment and discipline thereof. According to Article 309 (2) of the Constitution, the State shall, by law, make provision for the recruitment, training, discipline and conditions of service of persons employed in civil service of the Union and of persons employed in civil services under the control of the appropriate Government. According to Article 309 (3) of the Constitution, the State shall, by law, make provision for the retirement of persons employed in civil service of the Union and of persons employed in civil services under the control of the appropriate Government. Article 309 (3) of the Constitution provides that the State shall make provision for the retirement of persons employed in civil service of the Union and of persons employed in civil services under the control of the appropriate Government, by a rule or law made by the appropriate Government. Article 309 (4) of the Constitution provides that the State shall, by law, make provision for the retirement of persons employed in civil service of the Union and of persons employed in civil services under the control of the appropriate Government, by a rule or law made by the appropriate Government. Article 309 (4) of the Constitution provides that the State shall, by law, make provision for the retirement of persons employed in civil service of the Union and of persons employed in civil services under the control of the appropriate Government, by a rule or law made by the appropriate Government. Article 309 (4) of the Constitution provides that the State shall, by law, make provision for the retirement of persons employed in civil service of the Union and of persons employed in civil services under the control of the appropriate Government, by a rule or law made by the appropriate Government. Article 309 (4) of the Constitution provides that the\nActual: A new political party called Telugu Desam swept to power in the 1983 Andhra Pradesh Assembly elections, within a month of assuming office, the new Government of Andhra Pradesh, passed an order No. G.O.M.S. 36 GAD Services dated 8.2.83 (appending two Notifications) stating that in order to provide greater employment opportunities to the youths it had decided to reduce the age of superannuation of all Government employees, other than those in the last grade service, from 58 to 55 years with elect from February 28, 1983.\nOver 18,000 employees and 10,000 public sector employees were superannuated, as a result of the order.\nThe aggreived employees, therefore filed writ petitions and challenged the constitutional validity of the said order and Notifications under Articles 14, 16, 21 and 300A of the Constitution.\nAccording to the petitioners: (i) there was no basis at all for reducing the age of retirement from 58 to 55, as nothing had happened since October 29,1979 on which date the age limit was raised from 55 to 58 years; (ii) providing employment opportunities to the youths has no relevance on the question of fixing the age of retirement; (iii) the government had exercised its power arbitrarily without having regard to factors which are relevant on the fixation of the age of retirement; (iv) the government had acted unreasonably in not giving any previous notice to the employees which would have enabled them to arrange their affairs on the eve of retirement; (v) the government was estopped from reducing the age of retirement to 55 since the employees had acted on the representations made to them in 1979 by increasing the age of retirement from 55 to 58; (vi) as a result of the increase in the age of retirement from 55 to 58 years in 1979, a vested right had accrued to the 580 employees.\nwhich could be taken away if at all, only from future entrants to the government service; (vii) retirement of experienced and mature persons from government service will result in grave detriment to public services of the State (viii) the decision of the government is bad for a total non application of the mind to the relevant facts and circumstances bearing on the question of age of retirement like increased longevity; and (ix) the government had not even considered the enormous delay which would be caused in the payment of pensionary benefits to\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInput: Civil Appeals Nos.\n1264 67/71 etc.\nFrom the Judgment and Order dated 26.12.69 of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh at Hyderabad in W.P.

Court is assailed by the Union of India where the challenge to the validity of section 28 of the Gold Control Act, 1968 has succeeded.\nThe challenge to the other provisions of the Act at the instance of persons engaged in gold trade, i.e, manufacturers, shroffs and dealers in gold was rejected by the High Court.\nSection 28 of the Act runs thus: \"28.\nMoney lending business not to be carried on in licensed premises No licensed dealer shall unless authorised by the Administrator so to do, (a) carry on business as a money lender or banker on the security of any article, or ornament, or both, (b) permit any other person to carry on money lending, banking or any other business, in the same premises in which he carried on business as such dealer.\n\" The High Court has struck down the aforesaid provision only on the ground that it suffers from the vice of excessive delegation of legislative power inasmuch as no criteria or guide lines have been 954 provided by reference to which the power conferred on the Administrator to refuse permission or grant permission should be exercised and that the section confers an arbitrary, uncanalised power upon the Administrator with the result that the licensed dealer is at his mercy while seeking permission to carry on money lending or banking business on the security of any article, ornament or both in the same premises in which he carried on business as such dealer.\nThe High Court's reasoning in this behalf is to be found in its judgment at page 87 of the paper book and it runs thus: \"The Administrator as is evident from this provision, is given unlimited authority or power to refuse permission or to grant permission.\nNo rules have been framed prescribing the conditions or circumstances under which the Administrator could refuse permission or grant permission.\nA dealer is at the mercy of the Administrator and is help less against the arbitrary exercise of the power by the Administrator when he chooses to negative the request.\nIt is clear that Section 28 confers an arbitrary and uncanalised power without any criteria for guiding the discretion of the Administrator.\nFurther, the section does not provide nor is any rule brought to our notice which enjoins upon the Administrator to give a hearing to dealer who seeks permission under this Section and give reasons in case he decides to refuse the permission.\n\" Incidentally the High Court also proceeded to draw analogy from the reasoning adopted by this Court in its decision in Harakchand Ratanchand Banthias vs Asst.\ncollector of Central Excise Poona, II Division while declaring sec.\n27(6) of the Act, as it stood prior to its amendment by the Amending Act No. 26 of 1969, constitutionally invalid on the ground of conferal of a very wide and vague power upon the Administrator to grant or renew a license to a dealer.\nFor the reasons which we shall indicate presently it is impossible to the reasoning given by the High Court for striking down sec.\n28 in the manner done and in our view the analogy drawn by the High Court from the reasoning adopted by this Court while dealing with unamended sec.\n27(6) of the Act is clearly inapplicable.\nIt is true that no express rule prescribing the conditions or circumstances under which the permission can be granted or refused (1) 955 has been framed nor any particular guide line has been expressly indicated in sec.\n28 by reference to which the power conferred upon him thereunder could be exercised by the Administrator, but that is not decisive of the matter.\nIt cannot be disputed that sec.\n28 is part and parcel of the entire scheme of Gold Control as envisaged by the Act and the object of the enactment and the scheme affords sufficient guidance to the Administrator in the matter of exercising his discretion under that section.\nThe main object in putting the Act on the Statute Book as indicated by its long title is \"to provide, in the economic and financial interests of the community, for the control of the production, manufacture, supply, distribution, use and possession of, and business in, gold ornaments and articles of gold and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.\n\" In Harakchand Banthria's case (supra) this Court has further pointed out that even though import of gold into India had been banned considerable quantities of contraband gold were smuggled into India from Pakistan and China and that in such a situation, the only effective means of checking such smuggling was to grant license to dealers to import gold.\nSimilarly, in the present case, the object of the Gold Control Act, 1968 is to prevent the importation of gold into India, but for that purpose, the Act has provided for the regulation of the manufacture, manufacture and supply of gold articles and ornaments.\nThe power to regulate the manufacture and supply of gold articles and ornaments is necessarily linked with the power to permit the importation of gold.\nTherefore, the Administrator's power to permit the importation of gold into India by granting license to dealers is not an arbitrary or uncanalised power.\nIt is also not possible to draw a parallel between the situation in Harakchand Banthia's case (supra) and the present case, because in Harakchand Banthia's case the importation of gold into India was banned and the power to grant license to dealers was necessary to check the smuggling of gold.\nIn contrast, in the present case, the importation of gold into India is permitted but the manufacture and supply of gold articles and ornaments is regulated and it is for that purpose that the Administrator is given power to permit the importation of gold into India by granting license to dealers.\nThe power to permit the importation of gold into India is necessary for the purpose of regulating the manufacture and supply of gold articles and ornaments and it is not arbitrary or uncanalised power.\nTherefore, the power to permit the importation of gold into India by granting license to dealers is not an arbitrary or uncanalised power and the analogy drawn by the High Court from the reasoning adopted by this Court in Harakchand Banthia's case (supra) is clearly inapplicable.\nThe High Court has also relied upon the judgment of this Court in Ramesh Chandra vs. Union of India (1964) 12 S.C.T. 419 (hereinafter referred to as \"Ramesh Chandra's case\"), where the Constitutionality of sec. 16 of the Excise Act, 1944 was challenged on the ground that it suffers from the vice of excessive delegation of legislative power. It was held by this Court in that case that the provision suffers from the vice of excessive delegation of legislative power inasmuch as no criteria or guidelines have been provided by reference to which the power conferred on the Administrator to refuse permission\nActual: Section 28 of the Gold Control Act, 1968 bars money lending business to be carried on in licensed premises, either by the licensed dealer or by any other person unless authorised by the Administrator to do so.\nDrawing analogy from the reasoning adopted by the Supreme Court in its decision reported in Harakchand Ratanchand Banthia vs Assistant Collector or Central Excise, Poona, II Division, [1970] I SCR 479=AIR, the High Court of Andhra Pradesh struck down the said provision on the ground that it suffers from the vice of excessive delegation of legislative power in as much, as no criteria or guidelines have been provided by reference to which the power conferred on the Administrator to refuse permission or grant permission should be exercised and that the section confers an arbitrary, uncanalised and unfettered power upon the Administrator with the result that the licensed dealer is at his mercy while seeking permission to carry on money lending or banking business on the security of any article, ornament or both in the same premises in which he carried on business as such dealer.\nHence the appeal by special leave.\nAllowing the appeal, the Court ^ HELD: 1.1 Section 28 of the Gold Control Act, 1968 cannot be struck down on the ground of excessive delegation of legislative power and its validity must be upheld.\n[957C] 1.3 It is true that no express rule prescribing the conditions or circumstances under which the permission can be granted or refused has been framed nor any particular guide line has been expressly indicated in section 28 by reference to which the power conferred upon him thereunder could be exercised by the Administrator, but that is not decisive of the matter.\n[954H; 955A] 952 1.3 Section 28 of the Gold Control Act, 1968 is part and parcel of the entire scheme of the Gold Control Act the objective, the policy and the scheme of the Act together with the necessity to ensure prevention of circumvention of the other provisions of the Act afford more than sufficient guidance to the Administrator in the matter of exercising the power or discretion conferred on him under section 28.\nThe several restrictions that have been put on the activities of the traders doing business in gold will have to be viewed, in the light of the purpose or which the Gold Control Act was passed viz., that even though import of gold into India had been banned considerable quantities of contraband gold were finding their way into the country through illegal channels affecting the national economy and hampering\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInput: minal Appeals Nos.\n91 to 93 of 1954.\nAppeals by Special Leave granted by Supreme Court on the 18th January, 1954 from the Judgment and Order dated the 18th June, 1953 of the High Court of Judicature at Hyderabad in Confirmation Case No. 376/6 of 1952 53 and Criminal Appeals Nos.394/6, 395/6 and 392/6 of 1952 53 arising out of the Judgment and Order dated the 2nd June, 1952 of the Court of the Sessions Judge at Bidar in Sessions Case No. 9/8 of 1951 52.\nJ.

He agreed with the first about the convictions and adjudged all five to be guilty under section 302.\nOn the question of sentence he considered that the death sentences on the three appellants, Pandurang, Tukia and Bhilia, should be maintained and that those of the other two should be commuted to transportation for life.\nIt seems that the opinion of the third Judge was accepted as the decision of the Court and so the sentences suggested by him were maintained as well as the convictions.\nAll five convicts then applied to the High Court for leave to appeal.\nThe petition was heard by Ali Khan and Reddy, JJ.\nand they made the following order: \"The circumstances of the crime in this case were such that a brutal murder had been committed and sentence of death was the only one legally possible for the Sessions Judge to have passed and it was confirmed by the High Court\".\nLeave to appeal was refused.\nPandurang, Tukia and Bhilia, who were sentenced to death, applied here for special leave to appeal.\nTheir petition was granted.\nThe other two have not appealed.\nThe prosecution case is this.\nOn 7 12 1950, about 3 o 'clock in the afternoon,, Ramchander Shelke (the deceased) went to his field known as \"Bhavara\" with his wife's sister Rasika Bai (P.W.1) and his servant Subhana Rao (P.W.7).\nRasika Bai started to pick chillies in the field while Ramehander went to another field \"Vaniya che seth\" which is about a furlong away.\nWe gather that this field is near a river called 1086 Papana.\nAnyway, Rasika Bai heard shouts from that direction, so she ran to the river bank with Subhana and they both say that they saw all five accused attacking Ramchander with axes and sticks.\nTwo other persons, Laxman (P.W.6) and Elba (P.W.5), who were in the neighbourhood, also heard the cries and ran to the spot.\nThey also say they witnessed the assault and name all five accused.\nThe former has a field near by and was working in it; the latter was a passer by.\nRasika Bai shouted out to the assailants not to beat Ramchander but they threatened her and then ran away.\nRamehander died on the spot almost immediately.\nThere are four eye witnesses, and the main question we have to consider is whether they can be believed.\nOrdinarily, we would not have enquired into questions of fact but as three persons have been sentenced to death on the opinion of the third Judge, despite the opinion of one that the death sentence should not be imposed and of the other that the appellants are not guilty and so should be acquitted, we have deemed it advisable to examine the evidence.\nTwo of the eye witnesses were considered unreliable by Reddy, J. in the High Court, so we will omit them from consideration and concentrate on the other two, Rasika Bai (P.W.1) and Subhana (P.W.7).\nBoth give substantially the same version of what they saw of the assault.\nThey say that Ramchander was attacked by the five accused and that he was killed.\nThey also agree that the accused threatened Rasika Bai and ran away.\nSubhana Rao is an old man of 70 years and had been a servant of Ramehander for many years.\nHe says that he saw Ramchander with the accused in the field \"Vaniya che seth\" and that they were discussing something before the assault took place.\nHe also saw the accused running away with the axe and the axe lying on the ground.\nIt is alleged that this old man is a weak witness.\nHowever, we have to consider the whole evidence and not just the testimony of P. W. 1 and P. W. 7.\nWe also have to consider the testimony of other witnesses, such as P. W. 2 to 6.\nThe prosecution also produced the body of the deceased and it was found that it had been severely mutilated.\nThis is strong circumstantial evidence of the commission of the crime.\nWe now turn to the defence of the appellants and the defence raised on their behalf.\nIt is alleged that there was a long-standing feud between Ramchander and Bhilia, and that Bhilia had been threatening Ramchander and his family for a long time.\nIt is also alleged that Bhilia had a grudge against the family of Ramchander because he was refused a loan of 10,000 rupees.\nIt is alleged that Bhilia had threatened to kill Ramchander and his family.\nThe prosecution also produced evidence that Bhilia had a criminal record and had been in prison several times.\nBhilia's defence is that he had no connection with the deceased and that he was not present at the scene of the crime.\nThe defence of Tukia is that he was present at the scene but he was there to protect his brother Pandurang who was in love with Rasika Bai.\nIt is alleged that Tukia had a long-standing feud with Ramchander and that he had been threatening him for a long time.\nTukia's defence is that he was not present at the scene and that he was not involved in the crime.\nThe defence of Pandurang is that he was present at the scene but he was not involved in the assault.\nIt is alleged that Pandurang and Bhilia had a long-standing feud with Ramchander and that they had been threatening him for a long time.\nThe defence of the other two accused, Bhogarao and Lakshman\nActual: It is well settled that common intention in section 34 of tile Indian Penal Code presupposes prior concert.\nIt requires a prearranged plan because before a man can be vicariously convicted for the criminal act of another, the act must have boon done in furtherance of the common intention of them all.\nAccordingly there must have been a prior meeting of minds.\nSeveral persons can simultaneously attack a man and each can have the same intention, namely the intention to kill, and each can individually inflict a separate fatal blow and yet none would have the common intention required by the section because there was no prior meeting of minds to form a pre arranged plan.\nIn a case like that, each would be individually liable for whatever injury he caused but none could be vicariously convicted for the act of any of the others; and if the prosecution cannot prove that his separate blow was a fatal one he cannot be convicted of the murder however clearly an intention to kill could be proved in his case.\nCare must be taken not to confuse same or similar intention with common intention; the partition which divides their bounds is often very thin, nevertheless the distinction is real and substantial, and if overlooked will result in miscarriage of justice.\nThe plan need not be elaborate, nor is a long interval of time required.\nIt could arise and be formed suddenly, But there must 139 1084 be pre arrangement and premeditated concert.\nIt is not enough, to have the same intention independently of each other.\nThe inference of common intention should never be reached unless it is a necessary inference deducible from the circumstances of the case.\nIt is a question of fact in every case and however similar the circumstances, facts in one case cannot be used as a precedent to determine the conclusion on the facts in another.\nAll that is necessary is either to have direct proof of prior concert, or proof of circumstances which necessarily lead to that inference, or, in other words, the incriminating facts must be incompatible with the innocence of the accused and incapable of ex planation on any other reasonable hypothesis.\nWhen appellate judges, who agree on the question of guilt differ on that of sentence, it is usual not to impose the death penalty unless there are compelling reasons.\nBarendra Kumar Ghosh vs King Emperor ([1924] L.R. 52 I.A. 40), Mahbub Shalt vs King Emperor ([1945] L.P. 72 I.A. 148) and Mamand vs Emperor (A.I.R., referred to.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInput: Tax Reference Cases Nos. 3 to 5 of 1975 Tax Reference under Section 257 of the Income tax Act, 1961 made by the Income tax Appellate Tribunal, Cuttack Bench, Cuttack P.A.

was in law justified in including in the net wealth of the assessee interest due on accrual basis (though not realised) on the outstandings of the money lending business, the accounts of the assessee being maintained on cash basis?\" The respondent assessee was assessed to wealth tax for the assessment years 1965 66, 1966 67 and 1967 68 (the respective valuation dates being March 31, 1965, March 31, 1966 and March 31, 1967), in the status of a 'Hindu Undivided Family.\nIn each of the assessments, the Wealth Tax Officer included a sum of Rs. 1,50,000 estimated as the accrued interest on the assessee's money lending investments.\nThe assessee appealed to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and urged that as it maintained its books of account in accordance with the cash system of accounting the accrued interest on the money lending investments could not be included in the wealth tax assessments.\nThe contention found favour with the Appellate Assistant Commissioner, and accordingly he deleted the additions of Rs. 1,50,000 representing accrued interest.\nIn doing so the Appellate Assistant Commissioner followed \"Commissioner of Wealth tax Bihar and Orissa vs Vysyaraju Badreenarayana Moorthy Raju (Orissa)(1), The Wealth Tax Officer appealed to the Appellate Tribunal and contended that accrued interest was liable to be included in the wealth tax assessments of the assessee.\nThe Wealth Tax Officer sought support from a judgment of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Vedreva Venkappa Rao vs Commissioner of Wealth tax(2) A.P.\nThe Appellate Tribunal observed that the judgment of the Orissa High Court was binding on it, and accordingly by a consolidated order dated April 3, 1972, it dismissed the appeals.\nThe Commissioner of Wealth Tax applied under sub section\n(1) of section 27 of the Wealth (1) (2) 309 Tax Act for a reference of the cases to this Court in view of the conflict of opinion between the Orissa High Court and the Andhra Pradesh High Court, and so these references have been made.\nThe question can be disposed of shortly.\nUnder section 3 of the Wealth Tax Act, wealth tax is charged for every assessment year in respect of the net wealth of the assessee on the corresponding valuation date.\nThe expression \"net wealth\" is defined by cl.\n(m) of s.2 of the Act as \"the amount by which the aggregate value..\nOf all the assets, wherever located, belonging to the assessee on the valuation date. is in excess of the aggregate value of all the debts owed by the assessee on the valuation date. \" According to the scheme of the Wealth Tax Act, the net wealth of an assessee has to be determined as it obtains on a particular date.\nThat is the \"valuation date\".\nClause (q) of s 2 defines the expression \"valuation date\" as follows: ; \"(q) Valuation date, in relation to any year for which an assessment is to be made under this Act, means the last day of the previous year as defined in (Section 3) of the Income Tax Act, if an assessment were to be made under that Act for that year; Provided that (i) Where in the case of an assessee there are different previous years under the Income Tax Act for different sources of income, the valuation date for the purposes of this Act shall be the last day of the last of the previous years aforesaid, (ii) in the case of a person who is not an assessee within the meaning of the Income Tax Act, the valuation date for the purposes of this Act shall be the 31st day of March immediately preceding the assessment (z year; (iii)where an assessment is made in pursuance of section 19A, the valuation date shall be the same valuation date as would have been adopted in respect of the net wealth of the deceased if he were alive.\n\" 310 The computation of the net wealth of an assessee calls for a determination of his assets and debts as on the valuation date.\nThe definition of net wealth provided by clause (m) of s. 2 of the Act, inter alia, includes the \"accrued interest\" on the outstandings of the money lending business.\nHowever, it is to be noted that the Act does not provide for the inclusion of interest due but not realised on the net wealth of the assessee.\nThe question in this case, however, does not seek to consider the situation where interest due but not realised on the outstandings of the money lending business is included in the net wealth of the assessee.\nRather, the question seeks to consider the situation where interest due on accrual basis on the outstandings of the money lending business is included in the net wealth of the assessee, though it was not realised.\nThe issue, therefore, is whether the accrued interest on the outstandings of the money lending business can be included in the net wealth of the assessee when it has not been realised.\nThe answer to this question is to be determined with reference to the provisions of the Act, which, as we have already noted, defines net wealth as the amount by which the aggregate value of all assets of the assessee on the valuation date is in excess of the aggregate value of all debts owed by the assessee on the valuation date.\nIn the present case, the assessee maintained its books of account on the cash basis, while the Wealth Tax Officer had computed the net wealth of the assessee by including the accrued interest on the outstandings of the money lending business.\nThe question, therefore, is whether the Wealth Tax Officer was justified in including the accrued interest in the net wealth of the assessee.\nWe are of the opinion that the Wealth Tax Officer was not justified in including the accrued interest in the net wealth of the assessee.\nThe accrued interest on the outstandings of the money lending business was not realised and the assessee had not taken any provision for it.\nThe accrued interest on the outstandings of the money lending business is not an asset of the assessee.\nThe accrued interest on the outstandings of the money lending business is merely a future claim against the assessee's debtors.\nThe accrued interest on the outstandings of the money lending business is not a part of the assets of the assessee and, therefore, it cannot be included in the net wealth of the assessee.\nThe Wealth Tax Officer, however, was justified in computing the net wealth of the assessee by including the outstandings of the money lending business.\n\nActual: The respondent assessee was assessed to wealth tax for the assessment years 1965 66, 1966 67 and 1967 68, in the status of a Hindu Undivided Family '.\nIn each of the assessment years, the Wealth Tax Officer included a sum of Rs. 1.5 lakhs estimated as the accrued interest on the assessee's money lending investments.\nThe assessee appealed to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner, con tending that as the books of account were maintained in accordance with the cash system of accounting, the accrued interest on the money lending investment could not be included in the Wealth Tax assessments, the Appellate Assistant Commissioner following the decision of the Orissa High Court in Commissioner of Wealth tax Bihar and Orissa vs Vysyaraju Badreenarayana Moorthy Raju (Orissa) (1971)79 ITR 330 deleted the additions representing accrued interest.\nThe Wealth Tax Officer, appealed to the Appellate Tribunal and con tended that the accrued interest was liable to be included in the Wealth Tax assessment of the assessee, relying on the judgment of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Vedrevu Venkappa Rao vs Commissioner of Wealth Tax A.P.\nThe Appellate Tribunal dismissed the appeal, as it was bound by the decision of the Orissa High Court.\nThe Commissioner of Wealth Tax applied under Section 27(1) of the Wealth Tax Act, 1957 for a reference to the Supreme Court in view of the conflict of opinions between the Orissa High Court and the Andhra Pradesh High Court and the question: \"Whether the Wealth Tax Officer was justified in including in the net wealth of the assessee, interest due on accrual basis (though not realised) on the outstandings 307 of the assessee's money lending business, the accounts being maintained on cash,\" was referred to this Court.\n^ HELD: 1.\nEven though the accounts of the assessee are maintained on cash basis interest due on accrual basis, though not realised, on the out standings of the money, lending business is liable to be included in the net wealth of the assessee.\n[310G] 2.\nThe value of a property refers to the value of the rights in that property.\nWhat accrues as a right also falls to be

(Criminal) No. 316 of 1986, set aside the order of detention.\nThe High Court in its judgment and order dated 27.2.1986, held that the order of detention was passed without giving adequate reasons and the said order of detention was, therefore, illegal.\nThe High Court held that the grounds of detention were not based on any concrete evidence and that the subject had been involved in criminal activities, but the facts of those criminal cases were not linked to the grounds of detention.\nThe High Court also held that the detaining authority had not considered the fact that the subject was a politician and that his involvement in criminal activities was due to his political position.\nThe High Court also held that the detaining authority had not considered the fact that the subject had been facing opposition from Birendra Pratap Singh.\nThe High Court held that the grounds of detention were not based on any concrete evidence and that the subject had been involved in criminal activities, but the facts of those criminal cases were not linked to the grounds of detention.\nThe High Court also held that the detaining authority had not considered the fact that the subject was a politician and that his involvement in criminal activities was due to his political position.\nThe High Court also held that the detaining authority had not considered the fact that the subject had been facing opposition from Birendra Pratap Singh.\nThe High Court held that the grounds of detention were not based on any concrete evidence and that the subject had been involved in criminal activities, but the facts of those criminal cases were not linked\nActual: The respondent passed an order of detention in respect of the appellant under section 3(2) of the, on the ground that the appellant's activities were prejudicial to the maintenance of public order.\nSeveral criminal cases were pending against the appellant when the aforesaid order was passed.\nThe appellant had already surrendered in respect of a criminal charge against him before the order was served.\nHe filed a writ petition in the High Court challenging the detention order, but it was dismissed without any speaking order.\nAggrieved by the order of the High Court, the appellant filed the present criminal appeal by special leave as also a writ petition challenging the aforesaid order of detention on the ground that the order of preventive detention could only be justified against a person in detention if the detaining authority was satisfied that his release from detention was imminent and the order of detention was necessary for putting him back in jail.\nThe service of order of detention on the appellant/ petitioner while he was in jail was futile and useless since such an order had no application under section 3(2) of the Act.\nAllowing the writ petition and the appeal in part, ^ HELD: 1.\nThe continued detention of the detenu under the Act is not justified.\nThe order of detention therefore is set aside.\nHowever, this will not affect detenu's detention under the criminal cases.\nIf however, the detenu is released on bail in the criminal cases already pending against him, the matter of service of the detention order under the Act may be reconsidered by the appropriate authority in accordance with law.\n[912 E F] 906 2.\nIn our constitutional framework, the power of directing preventive detention given to the appropriate authorities must be exercised in exceptional cases as contemplated by the various provisions of the different statutes dealing with preventive detention and should be used with great deal of circumspection.\nThere must be awareness of the facts necessitating preventive custody of a person for social defence.\nIf a man is in custody and there is no imminent possibility of his being released, the power of preventive detention should not be exercised.\n[911 F G] In the instant case, when the actual order of detention was served upon the detenu the detenu was in jail.\nThere is no indication that this factor or the question that the said detenu might be released or that there was such a possibility of his release was taken into consideration by the detaining authority properly and seriously before the service of the order.\nIf there were cogent materials for thinking that the detenu\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInput: Appeal No. 1713(NT) of 1973.\nFrom the.\nJudgment and Order dated 6.1.1971 of the Allahabad High Court in Wealth Tax Reference No. 285 of 1965 124 S.C.

The case relates to the assessment year 1957 58 and the relevant date of valuation was 31st March, 1957.\nThe asses see, Dr. R.S. Gupta had maintained an account in the books of Messrs. Tika Ram and Sons Pvt.\nOn 1st January, 1957, the account showed a credit of Rs. 1,50,740.\nOn that day, the assessee had addressed a letter to the Company stating that he had decided to gift away for love and affection various sums to the following persons: 125 Ved Prakash Gupta.\nRs.25,000 Om Prakash Gupta.\nRs.25,000 Hari Prakash Gupta.\nRs.50,000 Pravin Kumar Gupta.\nRs. 50,000 By that letter the assessee had directed the Company to debit his account to the extent of Rs. 1,50,000 and credit the respective amounts in the names of the aforesaid per sons.\nIt appears further that copies of this letter were sent to one Om Prakash Gupta and Ved Prakash Gupta.\nThere was no dispute that instructions of the assessee were car ried out by the Company and relevant debit and credit en tries were made in the respective accounts.\nOn the same day i.e. on ist January, 1957, Om Parkash Gupta wrote to the assessee, his father, thanking him for the gift of Rs.25,000 made in his favour and the gift of Rs.50,000 in favour of his son Pravin.\nA similar letter was written by Ved Prakesh thanking the assessee, his father, for the gift of Rs.25,000 made to him and Rs.50,000 gifted to his son.\nIt must be mentioned, however, that the company i.e. Messrs Tika Ram and Sons.\nLtd. was stated to be running an oil mill and carrying on business as grain tillers.\ncontractors and brick kiln owners.\nIt was also stated to be carrying on business of advancing money and taking money on loan when necessary.\nBut it appears that it was admitted position that Tika Ram & Sons had a cash balance of Rs.4000 only on 1.1.1957 and it did not have any overdraft facilities with any bank.\nThe respective donees were stated to have later on withdrawn amounts from the amounts so transferred to their accounts.\nThe assessee contended that a total sum of Rs. 1,50,000 was validly gifted by him to his sons and grand sons and hence the amounts had been wrongly included in his net wealth by the Income Tax Officer and the Appellate Assistant Commissioner.\nIt was his contention that Tika Ram & Sons carried on the business of banking and hence the gifts were valid.\nBut there was no evidence that Tika Ram and Sons were carrying on any banking business.\nThe Tribunal held that they were not carrying on banking business.\nThe main question therefore that falls for consid eration is whether gifts in question made by transfer en tries in the books of the assessee's business concern, Tika Ram & Sons were valid. The Tribunal was of the view that the assessee was carrying on a business of grain tillers and contractors and brick kiln owners and the company was not carrying on banking business. The Tribunal also held that there was no consideration for the transfer and hence the amounts were not validly gifted.\nOn the facts of the case, the assessee had stated that the transfers were made for love and affection and were therefore valid gifts. But the Tribunal accepted the assessee's contention that there was no consideration for the transfer and hence the amounts were not validly gifted. The Tribunal held that the gifts were made by the assessee and therefore the asses see had to bear the burden of proving that the gifts were valid.\nIn order to prove that a gift was valid, the assessee had to prove that the gift was made without any consideration.\nIn the instant case, the assessee had failed to prove that the gifts were made without any consideration.\nThe asses see had not proved that the gifts were made without any consideration.\nThe asses see had not proved that the gifts were made without any consideration.\nThe asses see had not proved that the gifts were made without any consideration.\nThe asses see had not proved that the gifts were made without any consideration.\nThe asses see had not proved that the gifts were made without any consideration.\nThe asses see had not proved that the gifts were made without any consideration.\nThe asses see had not proved that the gifts were made without any consideration.\nThe asses see had not proved that the gifts were made without any consideration.\nThe asses see had not proved that the gifts were made without any consideration.\nThe asses see had not proved that the gifts were made without any consideration.\nThe asses see had not proved that the gifts were made without any consideration.\nThe asses see had not proved that the gifts were made without any consideration.\nThe asses see had not proved that the gifts were made without any consideration.\nThe asses see had not proved that the gifts were made without any consideration.\nThe asses see had not proved that the gifts were made without any consideration.\nThe asses see had not proved that the gifts were made without any consideration.\nThe asses see had not proved that the gifts were made without any consideration.\nThe asses see had not proved that the gifts were made without any consideration.\nThe asses see had not proved that the gifts were made without any consideration.\nThe asses see had not proved that the gifts were made without any consideration.\nThe asses see had not proved that the\nActual: The Income Tax Officer included in the net wealth of the respondent assessee for the assessement year 1957 58, two sums, viz., Rs. 1,50,000 and Rs.67,560/12/ which the asses see claimed to have gifted.\nIt is stated that on January 1, 1957 the respondent assessee, by a letter directed a company in which he maintained an account, to debit his account to the extent of Rs. 1,50,000 and credit in the names of his two sons and grandsons various sums, as he had decided to give away these amounts to them out of love and affection.\nThe company carried out the instructions and relevant debit and credit entries were made in the respective accounts.\nOn the same day, by two separate letters, the gifts were ac cepted by the sons and later on these amounts were withdrawn by the respective donees.\nIn the case of second gift, oral instructions were given for transferring the amounts stand ing to his credit.\nThe respondent assessee having failed before the Income Tax Officer and the Appellate Assistant Commissioner, ap pealed to the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal and contended that the first company was carrying on the business of banking and hence the gifts in question were valid, and that the Income Tax Officer and the Appellate Assistant Commis sioner had wrongly included these amounts in his net wealth and in the case of second gift, the assessee claimed that the amounts were gifted by him by transfer entries.\nThe Tribunal found that there was no evidence that the first company was carrying on any banking business, and in the case of second gift, the sum was available with the company.\nIt, therefore, held that the first company was not carrying on banking business, and in the 122 second case, there was no valid gift.\nIt, however, referred the matter to the High Court.\nThe High Court held that the Tribunal was not right in holding that the assessee did not make valid gifts and in holding that the amounts were rightly included in the net wealth of the assessee.\nAllowing the appeal by the Revenue, this Court, HELD: 1.\nIn order to constitute a valid gift there must be an existing property.\nIn case of entries in the books of account by credit and debit, the sums should be available on the date of gift in the account of the firm whose accounts are said to be credited or debited.\nIn the case of banking companies or other firms and companies who have\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInput: ivil Appeal No. 378 of 1987.\n237 From the Judgment and Order dated 4.8.1986 of the Cal cutta High Court in F.M.A.T.

Setia and Probir Choudhary for the Respondents.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by VENKATARAMIAH J.\nThe question involved in these appeals by special leave which are filed against the judgment dated August 17, 1985 of the High Court of Allahabad in Civil Miscellaneous Writ No. 6849 of 1984 relates to the constitu tional validity of regulation 19(2) of the Life Insurance Corporation of India (Staff) Regulations, 1960 (hereinafter referred to as 'the (Staff) Regulations, 1960 '), as amended on 21.1.\n1977 by the Life Insurance Corporation of India (hereinafter referred to as 'the Corporation ') which pro vides that an employee belonging to Class I or Class II appointed to the service of the Corporation on or after 1st September, 1956 shall retire on completion of 58 years of age but the competent authority may, if it is of the opinion that it is in the interest of the Corporation to do so, direct such employee to retire on completion of 50 years of age and at any time thereafter on giving him three months'notice or salary in lieu thereof.\nPrior to January,.\n1955 there were more than 200 insur ers carrying on life insurance business in India.\nAs it came to the notice of the Government that the Indian life insur ers, with a few exceptions, were virtually controlled by few individuals who were utilising the funds of those companies to the detriment of the industry and the policyholders, the Government decided to nationalise the life insurance busi ness.\nPursuant to the said decision, the President of India promulgated the Life Insurance (Emergency Provisions) Ordi nance, 1956 on January 19, 1956 providing for the vesting of the management of the life insurance business (which was called the controlled business under the Ordinance) which was being carried on by any insurer in India on that day in the Central Government and providing for its management.\nOn the passing of the said Ordinance the management of the controlled business of all the insurers in India thus vested in the Central Government and pending the appointment of the custodians for the controlled business of any insurer the person in charge of the management of such business immedi ately before the passing of the Ordinance was required to be in charge of the management of the business for and on behalf of the Central Government.\nThe Ordinance contained detailed provisions for the carrying on of the life insur ance business by 189 the Government for the time being.\nThe Ordinance was replaced by the which was published on 21st of March, 1956.\nThe said Act was followed by the (Act 31 of 1956) (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act ') which was published in the Gazette on 18th June, 1956.\nThe Act, howev er, came into force on 1st July, 1956.\nThe Act provided for the establishment and incorporation of the Corporation.\nThe Corporation was accordingly established on 1st September, 1956.\nUnder the Act the expression 'appointed day'is de fined as the date on which the Corporation is established.\nThe appointed day for the purposes of the Act is, therefore, September 1. 1956.\nBy virtue of section 7 of the Act on the appointed day all the assets and liabilities appertaining to the controlled business of all insurers, the management of which it had been taken over earlier by the Central Govern ment, stood transferred to and vested in the Corporation.\nWhen the Corporation thus came into existence it had no employees of its own to carry on the vast business of the large number of insurers which had been taken over by it.\nIt, therefore, became necessary to transfer the services of the existing employees of the insurers to the Corporation because without the services of those employees it was almost impossible for the Corporation to run the life insur ance business in India which involved management of the various offices situated in different parts of India, serv icing of lakhs of insurance policies, the administration of the assets taken over from the insurers and several other activities connected with the life insurance business.\nConsequently, the Corporation was required to recruit and appoint employees of its own.\nIn order to effect the transfer of the services of the existing employees of the insurers to the Corporation, the Government framed the (Staff) Regulations, 1960, which inter alia provided for the recruitment and appointment of the employees of the Corporation.\nOne of the provisions of the (Staff) Regulations, 1960, which is challenged in these appeals, is regulation 19(2) which provides that an employee belonging to Class I or Class II appointed to the service of the Corporation on or after 1st September, 1956 shall retire on completion of 58 years of age but the competent authority may, if it is of the opinion that it is in the interest of the Corporation to do so, direct such employee to retire on completion of 50 years of age and at any time thereafter on giving him three months notice or salary in lieu thereof.\nThe aforesaid regulation 19(2) was amended on 21st January 1977 by the Corporation by which the age of superannuation was reduced to 50 years.\nThe aforesaid amendments to regulation 19(2) of the (Staff) Regulations, 1960 were challenged in the High Court of Allahabad by the employees of the Corporation in Writ Petition No. 6849 of 1984 by which they prayed for a writ of certiorahi to quash the amendments to regulation 19(2) of the (Staff) Regulations, 1960 and for other reliefs.\nThe High Court of Allahabad by its judgment dated 17th August, 1985 (in Civil Miscellaneous Writ No. 6849 of 1984) held that the amendments to regulation 19(2) of the (Staff) Regulations, 1960, were ultra vires of the powers of the Corporation and, therefore, were not enforceable.\nThe Corporation has appealed against the said judgment of the High Court of Allahabad.\nThe main question involved in these appeals by special leave is the constitutional validity of regulation 19(2) of the (Staff) Regulations, 1960, as amended on 21st January, 1977.\nWe shall now examine the said regulation 19(2) of the (Staff) Regulations, 1960, as amended on 21st January, 1977.\nRegulation 19(2) of the (Staff) Regulations, 1960, which was\nActual: The Life Insurance Corporation was established on Sep tember 1, 1956 under the Life Insurance Act of 1956 (Act 31 of 1956) by amalgamating about 200 insurers carrying on life insurance business in the country.\nIt had no employees of its own to carry on the vast business which had been taken over and the nature of the work was such that the Corpora tion required the services of employees with experience and expertise in running life insurance business.\nIn order to meet the above need, Section 11 of the Act came to be enact ed.\nSub section (1) provided that with effect from September 1, 1956, every whole time employee of the erstwhile insurers would become an employee of the Corporation and hold office therein by the same tenure, at the same remuneration, and upon the same terms and conditions and with the same rights and privileges as to pension and gratuity and other matters as he would have held on September 1, 1956, had the Act not been passed.\nThe conditions of service of the employees whose serv ices were transferred to the Corporation under Section 11(1) were not uniform.\nThe conditions governing the retirement of those employees were also diverse and different.\nIn some cases the age of retirement had been fixed at 55 years, in some at 58 years and in some others at 60 years.\nIn many cases, the insurers had permitted their employees to contin ue in 181 their services even beyond 60 years depending upon their efficiency and physical capacity.\nFor the purposes of rationalising the pay scales of the transferred employees, under sub section (2) of Section 11 the Central Government was empowered to alter the terms of service of the employees as to their remuneration in such manner as it thought fit.\nThe sub section was amended by Acts 17 and 36 01'1957.\nClause (bb) of sub section (2) 01'Section 49 conferred power on the Corporation to make regulations with the previ ous approval of the Central Government as regards 'the terms and conditions of service of persons who had become employ ees of the Corporation under subsection (1) 01'Section 11 '.\nUnder clauses (b) and (bb) of Section 49(2) 01'the Act, Regulations were framed prescribing the ages of retirement of the employees of the Corporation belonging to different categories with the previous approval of the Central Govern ment and were incorporated in the Life Insurance Corporation of India\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInput: No. 7338 of 1981.\n(Under Article 32 of the Constitution of India).\nRam Jethmalani and Miss Rani

He had not attained the age of 55 years, and, therefore, the condition of F.R. 56(j)(ii) does not apply.\nHence, the appropriate authority is entitled to exercise power under clause (j) in the case of a Government servant in Class II service or post where he entered into service before attaining the age of 35 years after the said servant attained the age of 50 years.\nThe impugned order, therefore, is in accordance with the provisions of the Fundamental Rules and is, therefore, valid.\nIn view of the above, the petitioner's contention is not tenable and, therefore, the impugned order is correct and the petitioner's application is without merit.\nAccordingly, the petition is dismissed.\nIn the present case, the petitioner has not entered into service before attaining the age of 35 years and, therefore, the provisions of F.R. 56(j)(i) do not apply to the petitioner.\nHence, the impugned order is not contrary to the judgment delivered by this Hon'ble Court on 26.2.1980.\nThe impugned order is, therefore, valid.\nHence, the petitioner's contention is not tenable and, therefore, the impugned order is correct and the petitioner's application is without merit.\nIn view of the above, the petition is dismissed.\nNow, we have to consider the second ground of attack of the petitioner, which is to the effect that the impugned order is contrary to the judgment delivered by this Hon'ble Court on 26.2.1980, copy at Annexure C hereto, which was delivered in the case of Union of India vs. K.R.

but as the assessment was made on October 1, 1976 the provisions of the Act referred to above will not apply for 10 years from October 1, 1976 and therefore the suit could be decreed as the protection

basis of the date on which the suit was filed and it was contended that if on the date on which the suit was filed by the respondent the provisions of this Act were not applicable then merely because the proceedings have been pending for all these years it could not be contended that as now 10 years elapsed the decree could not be passed.\nLearned counsel placed reliance on a decision in Firms Amar Nath Basheshar Dass vs Tek Chand, 11972] 3 SCR 922 and contended that this is a decision of three Judges Bench which clearly hold that if the suit was filed within a period of exemption then the suit could be decreed and the provisions of the Act will not be applicable.\nLearned counsel further contended that in the decision in Vineet Kumar's case (supra) on which reliance has been placed by learned counsel for the appellant the Firms Amar Naath Basheshar Dass's case (supra) has not been referred to and decision in Vineet Kumar's case (supra) is a judgment by a Bench of two Judges.\nIt was also contended by learned counsel that as till the matter was pending in the High Court 10 years have not been completed and therefore the High Court passed the decree Now it could not be contended that as during the pendency of the proceedings in this Court 10 years have elapsed and therefore the appellant tenant will be entitled to protection of the provisions of Section 20 It was contended that it is well settled that if the right to file a suit accrues on the date of tiling of the suit then the rights will have to be determined on the basis of the law applicable on the date of the suit and not subsequently.\nLearned counsel for the appellant contended that the decision in 161 Firms Amar Nath Basheshar Dass's case (supra) is a decision of a two Judge Bench of the Supreme Court and in the Firms Amar Nath Basheshar Dass's case (supra) it was held that if the tenant filed a suit under the provisions of the Act within 10 years from the date of the assessment then the provisions of the Act will not apply to the suit and therefore the decree can be passed.\nIt was also contended that the provisions of the Act were not applicable to the present case as the date of filing of the suit was before the date of assessment i.e. June 25, 1976 and therefore the provisions of the Act will not be applicable.\nIt was contended by the learned counsel for the respondent that the provisions of the Act were applicable to the present case as the tenant had filed the suit within the period of exemption of 10 years from the date of assessment i.e. October 1, 1976.\nOn the basis of the above arguments it is seen that the High Court has allowed the revision petition and passed the decree in favour of the respondent.\nIn view of the decisions in Firms Amar Nath Basheshar Dass vs Tek Chand, 11972] 3 SCR 922 and Vineet Kumar vs Mangal Sain Wadhera, 11982] 3 SCR 491 the ratio of the decision in Vineet Kumar's case (supra) is that if the tenant had filed the suit within

Court of Bombay by its judgment and order dated 22nd April, 1983, has held that the law reports published by the 1st respondent are newspapers as defined in the Act and the employees of the 1st respondent who are non journalist newspaper employees are entitled to the benefits of the Act.\nThe question whether the law reports published by the 1st respondent are newspapers as defined in the Act and whether the employees of the 1st respondent who are non journalis newspaper employees are entitled to the benefits of the Act, are questions of law and fact.\nThe law reports published by the 1st respondent are in the form of printed periodical works containing public news or comments on public news.\nThey are published regularly in the form of supplements to the law journals and are not merely a compilation of news articles or reports published by other persons.\nThey are published by a news agency, that is the 1st respondent.\nThe 1st respondent is engaged in the business of

law reports aforementioned being published by the 1st respondent were newspapers within the meaning of the Act and whether the employees engaged in their production or distribution were entitled to the benefit of the orders made by the Central Government on the basis of the Palekar Award.\n[781F] In order to be a newspaper, a work must be (i) a printed work, (ii) a periodical, and (iii) should contain public news or comments on public news.\nAny other class of printed periodical work as may, from time to time, be notified in this behalf by the Central Government in the official Gazette, may also be a newspaper.\nThere was no dispute in this case that the law reports are printed works and that they are periodicals.\nThe only question which remained to be considered was whether they contained public news or comments on public news, Newspapers and 776 books are no doubt shown as separate items in Entry 39 of List III of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution, but the distinction between them sometimes becomes very thin or totally vanishes.\n[781G H;782A B] The law reports being published by the 1st respondent are reports of recent decisions of the Supreme Court of India and

Jain for the Respondents.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by JAGANNATHA SHETTY, J.\nThis appeal by special leave is from a judgment of the High Court of Allahabad dated November 6, 1985 passed in Civil Misc.\nWrit Petition No. 4211 of 1983.\nThe appeal raises a question of considerable importance.\nThe question is whether it is permissible to have two pay scales in the same cadre for persons having same duties and having same responsibilities.\nThe High Court has answered the question in the negative.\nIt is said that it would be violative of the Constitutional right of \"equal pay for equal work\".\nThe facts are not in dispute.\nThey will be found correctly stated in the judgment under appeal and may briefly be stated thus: Prior to 1965, in the High Court of Allahabad, Bench Secretaries were on a higher pay scale than that of Section Officers.\nThey were in the pay scale of Rs. 160 320 as against the pay scale of Rs. 120 300 to Section Officers.\nIn 1965 the State Government appointed a Pay Rationalisation Committee with wide ranging reference.\nThe Committee was asked to consider the duties and responsibilities of different categories of posts.\nIt was required to consider and recommend changes to reduce the number of then existing pay scales.\nIt was also asked to recommend as far as possible equal emoluments for identical duties and responsibilities.\nThe Committee submitted a detailed report, in which Bench Secretaries became casualties.\nThe Committee recommended for them a pay scale slightly lower than that of Section Officers.\nRs. 150 350 was recommended for Bench Secretaries as against Rs.200 400 for Section Officers.\nThe State Government accepted the recommendations.\nSubsequently, these pay scales were raised to Rs. 200 450 and Rs.5 15 715 respectively.\nBeing dissatisfied with the down grading, the Bench Secretaries made representation to the Government.\nThey demanded that they should at least be put at par with Section Officers if not on higher scale.\nThe High Court supported their case but half heartedly.\nThe High Court suggested \"that in view of financial exigencies the Government may grant for the time being pay scale to 10 PG NO 292 Bench Secretaries as admissible to Section Officers.\n\" When this matter was pending consideration, the Government appointed the Pay Commission (1971 72) headed by Shri Ali Zahir.\nOn February 1, 1973, the Pay Commission submitted its report.\nThe report did not accept the claim of Bench Secretaries for giving them pay scale equal to Section Officers or Private Secretaries.\nThe report was in fact very much against them.\nThe following remarks of the Pay Commission would be pertinent: \"9 Bench Secretaries (Sakna Suchiv) A memorandum from the Bench Secretaries given to us states that the post which are at present in the scale of Rs. 100 450 are of a great responsibility for which experience and special qualifications are required.\nThey have claimed that their duties are equivalent to Private Secretaries of Hon 'ble Judges and have demanded the same pay scale which is given to Private Secretaries and the Section Officers.\nThe Registrar of the High Court while forwarding the memorandum has suggested that they should also be given the same pay scale which is given to Superintendents i.e. Rs.515 40 715 or to the Section Officers i.e. Rs.350 750.\nIt is not necessary to emphasise that in comparison to Bench Secretaries, the Section Officers of the secretariat has to bear more responsibilities in their Section and have to control over its subordinates.\nSection Officers have to prepare a lengthy and original notes in complicated and important matters.\nTherefore, the responsibilities of the two posts cannot be said to be equal.\nKeeping in view the present scale of pay.\nthe pay scale recommended by the Pay Rationalisation Committee, the nature of duties and responsibilities and the fact that every Hon 'ble Judge will have one Private Secretary in the scale of Rs.500 1,000 we feel that the Bench Secretaries cannot be given the same scale of pay which is being given to Superintendents or the Section Officers.\nSince the Bench Secretaries are promoted from Upper Division Assistants, they should feel satisfied if they are placed in a scale of pay a little above the Upper Division Assistants.\nTherefore, we have recommended for them a pay scale of Rs.400 15 475 20 575 25 750.\n\" It will be seen that the Pay Commission refused to equate Bench Secretaries with Section Officers in view of their differential duties.\nIt was held that Bench Secretaries were not comparable to Section Officers in view of the greater responsibilities of the former.\nIt will be seen that the Bench Secretaries were not placed in the same pay scale as that of Section Officers.\nThe Bench Secretaries, therefore, felt dissatisfied and the matter went up in appeal.\nThe High Court was asked to consider whether it was permissible for the Government to have two pay scales in the same cadre for persons having the same duties and responsibilities.\nThe High Court was required to consider whether the Pay Commission's recommendations were proper.\nThe High Court accepted the argument that Bench Secretaries had greater responsibilities than Section Officers.\nThe High Court, however, also accepted the argument that Bench Secretaries had identical duties with Section Officers.\nThe High Court, therefore, held that Bench Secretaries should be paid at par with Section Officers.\nThe High Court, however, took a half hearted view.\nThe High Court, therefore, directed the Government to consider the matter again and to decide it within six months.\nOn the basis of the High Court's direction, the Government, on January 8, 1985, issued a notification proposing the pay scale of Rs. 200 400 for Bench Secretaries and Rs. 150 350 for Section Officers.\nThe Bench Secretaries challenged the notification.\nThey challenged the notification on the ground that it was violative of the principles of \"equal pay for equal work\".\nThe High Court, as we have seen, dismissed the writ petition.\nHence, this appeal.\nThe main issue raised in this appeal is whether it is permissible to have two pay scales in the same cadre for persons having the same duties and responsibilities.\nThe question is whether it is permissible for the Government to have two pay scales for Bench Secretaries and Section Officers having the same duties and responsibilities.\nThe Bench Secretaries argue that the High Court was right in holding that Bench Secretaries should be paid at par with Section Officers.\nThe Bench Secretaries argue that Bench Secretaries were paid a lower pay scale than Section Officers.\nThey argue that Bench Secretaries were paid a lower pay scale than Section Officers and that Bench Secretaries were paid a lower pay scale than Private Secretaries.\nThe Bench Secretaries also argue that Bench Secretaries were paid a lower pay scale than Superintendents.\nThe Bench Secretaries argue that Bench Secretaries were paid a lower pay scale than Section Officers and that Bench Secretaries were paid a lower pay scale than Superintendents.\nThe Bench Secretaries argue that Bench Secretaries were paid a lower pay\nActual: Prior to 1955, the Bench Secretaries in the Allahabad High Court were on a higher pay scale than that of the Section Officers.\nIn 1965, the State Government appointed a Pay Rationalisation Committee to consider the duties and responsibilities of different categories of posts and recommend changes.\nThe Committee recommended for the Bench Secretaries a pay scale lower than that of the Section Officers.\nThe Bench Secretaries made a representation to the Government that they be put at par with the Section Officers if not on a higher scale.\nThe Government appointed Pay Commission (l971 72).\nThe Pay Commission did not accept the claim of the Bench Secretaries.\nThe Bench Secretaries again moved the Government reiterating their demand, whereupon an \"Anomalies Committee\" was constituted.\nThe Committee rejected the claim of the Bench Secretaries for placing them at par with the Section Officers, but suggested that ten posts of Bench Secretaries be upgraded.\nThe Government accepted the recommendation and issued orders upgrading ten posts of Bench Secretaries to be called Bench Secretaries grade I, giving the nomenclature of Bench Secretaries grade Il to the rest of Secretaries.\nThe Bench Secretaries grade II moved the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution, challenging the bifurcation of their cadre into grade I & grade 11.\nThe High Court quashed the notification which created Bench Secretaries grade 1.\nThe State of l, '.P., aggrieved by the decision of the High Court, appealed to this Court.\nPG NO 288 PG NO 289 Two questions arose for consideration (i) whether the Bench Secretaries were entitled to pay scales admissible to Section officers, and (11) whether the creation of two grades with different pay scales in the cadre of Bench Secretaries doing the same or similar work was violative of the \"equal pay for equal work\".\nAllowing the appeal, the Court, HELD:(I) It requires of duties and responsibilities of the respective posts.\nFunctions of two posts may appear to be the same or similar, but there may be a difference in the performance.\nQuantity of work may be the same but quality may be different.\nThe equation of posts of equation of pay must be determined by expert bodies, like pay commissions.\nIf there is any determination by a Commission or Committee, the Court should normally accept it and not tinker with it unless it is shown to be made with extraneous consideration.\n[298G H;299A B] The Bench Secretaries were paid more emoluments than the section Officers,\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInput: ivil Appeal No. 4031 of 1988.\nFrom the Judgment and Order dated 14.4.1988 of the Patna High PG NO

PG NO 870 PG NO 871\nSpecial leave granted.\nSABYASACHI MUKHARJI, J. : Leave granted.\nThe facts of the case are as under:\nBy an auction notice, the Beni Country liquor shop was put up for sale in the year 1987. The auction notice specified that the highest bidder for the Beni Country liquor shop would have to deposit Rs.11,900 per month as dak. The auction was held on 27.3.88. The highest bidder for the Beni Country liquor shop was Shri Raghu Nath Thakur S/o Late Gorakh Nath. He was given the shop on the condition that he would deposit the dak amount every month. However, he did not deposit the dak amount.\nAfter the non-payment of the dak amount, the Collector of Samastipur district passed an order on 25.3.88 stating that the name of Shri Raghu Nath Thakur S/o Late Gorakh Nath was to be placed in the black list for future contracts. This order was passed in accordance with the orders of the Collector dated 14.3.88. However, no notice was given to the appellant in this regard. The appellant challenged this order before the Patna High Court. PG NO 872\nThe question that needs to be answered is whether the Collector can pass an order that places the name of a person on the black list without giving him a prior notice and an opportunity to make representations.\nThe answer to the question is in the affirmative. The principle of natural justice which requires that parties affected by any order should have right of being heard and making representations against the order, is an implied principle of the rule of law. In the present case, the order of the Collector is challenged on the ground that it is violative of the principle of natural justice.\nHowever, the Collector's order in question is not the one that is challenged. The order that is challenged is one that directs the black listing of the appellant in respect of future contracts.\nThe Collector's order that directs the black listing of the appellant in respect of future contracts is set aside because it is violative of the principle of natural justice. The Collector's order that directs the black listing of the appellant in respect of future contracts is set aside.\nHowever, it is not set aside the order that places the name of the appellant on the black list for future contracts. This order is not the one that is challenged.

In our opinion, the respondent had committed a serious breach of the trust placed in him by virtue of his office as Time Keeper.\nThe respondent's actions were not only contrary to the rules of the service but also an abuse of the trust reposed in him by the competent authority.\nTherefore, the penalty of dismissal from service, as awarded by the competent authority, is me t re adequate.\"\nThe respondent now appeals to this Court against the judgment and order of the Tribunal.\nHe has raised the following grounds of objection: (i) The Tribunal erred in holding that the respondent was the mastermind behind the scheme to defraud the project and (ii) The Tribunal erred in holding that the penalty of dismissal from service awarded by the competent authority was me t re adequate.\nThe respondent has also challenged the jurisdiction of the Central Tribunal to examine the adequacy of the penalty awarded by the competent authority.\nIt is now contended by the respondent that the Tribunal, by its order, has exceeded its jurisdiction by examining the adequacy of the penalty awarded by the competent authority.\nWe are in agreement with the respondent's contention and hold that the Tribunal erred in examining the adequacy of the penalty awarded by the competent authority.\nThe Administrative Tribunal Act, 1985, provides for the establishment of a Tribunal to hear and decide on various administrative matters including disciplinary proceedings against Government servants.\nThe provisions of the said Act are as follows: (1) (c) \"The Tribunal shall consist of one or more persons appointed by the Governor of the State in which the Tribunal is to be constituted and shall include a Judicial Member and one or more Legal Members.

The petitioners were appointed as Supervisors Grade 'A' on various dates between 1962 and 1966 and had been working satisfactorily for a period of two years in the said capacity. The respondents, however, contend that the petitioners were not promoted to the post of Chargeman Grade-II because they did not meet the criteria laid down by the D.G.O.F. for promotion to the said post. The respondents further contend that the petitioners were required to apply for the post of Chargeman Grade-II and were required to be screened by the Promotion Committee at the factory level and at the Central level before their promotion could be considered. The petitioners, however, claim that they were not required to apply for the post of Chargeman Grade-II and were not required to be screened by the Promotion Committee before their promotion could be considered. The question is whether the respondents were justified in refusing to promote the petitioners to the post of Chargeman Grade-II on the ground that they had not applied for the post of Chargeman Grade-II and had not been screened by the Promotion Committee before their promotion could be considered. We are of the view that the respondents were not justified in refusing to promote the petitioners to the post of Chargeman Grade-II on the ground that they had not applied for the post of Chargeman Grade-II and had not been screened by\nActual: The petitioners in the writ petitions were appointed as Supervisors Grade 'A'in various ordnance factories betwe en 1962 and 1966, in pursuance of circular dated 6th Novembe r, 1962 issued by the Director General of Ordnance Factorie section The circular further provided for promotion from Supervis or 'A'to Chargeman I1, on completion of two years'satisfact o ry service.\n75 Supervisors Grade 'A'had moved a writ petition in the Allahabad High Court in 1972.\nTheir grievance was th at even though quite a large number of Supervisors Grade'A'had been promoted to the post of Chargeman Grade II on completion of two years'satisfactory work, in pursuance of the circular dated 6th November, 1962, they had been di s criminated against and had not been so promoted immediate ly on the expiry of two years'service.\nThe writ petition was contested on the ground that t he promotion from Supervisor Grade 'A'to Chargeman II we re governed by the Indian Ordnance Factories (Recruitment a nd Conditions of Service of Grade III Personnel) Rules, 19 56 and such promotions could be made only in accordance wi th the procedure prescribed by Rule 8 of these Rules.\nThe learned Single Judge dismissed the writ petition on the ground of unexplained laches.\nThe Division Bench did n ot find any substance in the submission made on behalf of t he petitioners and dis 93 missed their special appeal.\nAccording to the Divisi on Bench, it was difficult to read in the circular that aft er two years of satisfactory service there would be automat ic promotion from Supervisor Grade 'A'to Chargeman II as su ch a view would militate against Rule 12 of the Rules, whi ch provided that no appointment shall be made otherwise than as specified in the Rules.\nIt was further held by the Divisi on Bench that even assuming that some Supervisors Grade 'A'h ad been automatically promoted on completion of two year s'service, without the recommendation after screening by t he Promotion Committee, as provided in Rule 8, no right wou ld accrue in favour of the appellants inasmuch as such prom o tions would be in the teeth of Rule 12.\nAgainst the judgment of the Division Bench, Civil Appe al No. 441 of 1981 (Virendra Kumar and Others vs Union of Ind ia and Others\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInput: (Civil) No. 548 of 1987.\n(Under Article 32 of the Constitution of India).\nM.C.

seen from the Memorandum of Associa tion is to preserve the traditional arts and crafts and also to popularise handicrafts and handloom items 665 in the State of Himachal Pradesh and other parts of the country and abroad.\nIn order to achieve this primary objec tive, the Corporation gives training to artisans, weavers and craftsmen in various traditional arts and crafts.\nDuring the period of training, the trainees are paid a stipend by the Corporation.\nUpto 31st March, 1987, the Corporation has imparted training to as many as 1662 persons in different areas like carpet weaving, handloom weaving, painting, metal crafts, wood carving, etc.\nApart from giving training, the Corporation also ensures marketing support to the artisans and craftsmen by purchasing their products at remunerative prices and sell them through the marketing network of the Corporation.\nIt is thus a service oriented organisation helping the village artisans and craftsmen to produce and market their products on remunerative prices.\nIt is said that the village artisans and craftsmen make different items on a piece rate basis and in some cases, they execute the work in their own homes.\nThe financial aspect of the Corporation is stated to be not encouraging, and indeed, it is disappointing.\nIt has suffered huge loss and the total losses accumulated hitherto is Rs.69.77 lakhs.\nNonetheless, for the purpose of preserv ing and promoting traditional arts and crafts, the Corpora tion has been kept alive.\nBut to avoid or minimise further loss, it is stated that the

Constitution.\nThe princi ple was incorporated only under Article 39(d) of the Consti tution as a Directive Principle of State Policy.\nPerhaps, for the first time, this Court in Randhir Singh vs Union of India, ; has innovated that it is a constitu tional goal capable of being achieved through constitutional remedies.\nThere the Court pointed out that that principle has to be read into Article 14 of the Constitution which enjoins the State not to deny any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the law and also into Article 42 of the Constitution which provides for the right to life and personal liberty.\nThe Court there held that the principle of \"equal pay for equal work\" is a principle of social justice, which is essential for the social and economic development of the country.\nThe Court also held that it is the duty of the State to promote the social and economic development of the country, and, therefore, the principle of \"equal pay for equal work\" is an integral part of the social and economic development of the country.\nThe Court further held that the State has a constitutional duty to ensure that the principle of \"equal pay for equal work\" is implemented in the country.\nThe Court also observed that it is not necessary for the State to pay the same wages to the petitioners as are paid to the regular employees of the Corporation, but the State should ensure that the petitioners are paid wages that are commensurate with their work.\nThe Court also held that the petitioners should be paid wages that are commensurate with their work and that the State should ensure that the petitioners are paid wages that are commensurate with their work.\nThe Court further held that the petitioners should be paid wages that are commensurate with their work and that the State should ensure that the petitioners are paid wages that are commensurate with their work.\nThe Court further held that the petitioners should be paid wages that are commensurate with their work and that the State should ensure that the petitioners are paid wages that are commensurate with their work.\nThe Court further held that the petitioners should be paid wages that are commensurate with their work and that the State should ensure that the petitioners are paid wages that are commensurate with their work.\nThe Court further held that the petitioners should be paid wages that are commensurate with their work and that the State should ensure that the petitioners are paid wages that are commensurate with their work.\nThe Court further held that the petitioners should be paid wages that are commensurate with their work and that the State should ensure that the petitioners are paid wages that are commensurate with their work.\nThe Court further held that the petitioners should be paid wages that are commensurate with their work and that the State should ensure that the petitioners are paid wages that are commensurate with their work.\nThe

rated carpenters at the Wood Working Centre of the Himachal Pradesh State Handi crafts Corporation sought enforcement of their fundamental right to have \"equal pay for equal work\" in terms paid to their counterparts in regular services, or in the alterna tive, the minimum wages prescribed by the Deputy Commission er for like categories of workmen.\nThe petitioners'claim was resisted by the respondents.\nTheir case was that the unit where the petitioners were working was a factory registered under the Factories Act, that they were treated as industrial workmen and given all benefits due to them under the various labour legislations, that the Government had not fixed the minimum wages payable to the workmen engaged in the Corporation or other like industries but the Corporation had adopted for its workmen the minimum wages payable for similar work in the construc tion industry, and that there were no regular employees of the petitioners'categories in its establishment and, as such, the question of payment to them the pay admissible to regular employees does not arise.\nDismissing the writ petition, HELD: 1.\nUnless it is shown that there is a discrimina tion amongst the same set of employees by the same master in the same establishment, the principle of \"equal pay for equal work\" cannot be enforced.\nA comparison cannot be made with counterparts in other establishments with different management, or even in establishments in different geograph ical location though owned by the same master.\n[668B] In the instant case, the petitioners were employed by a company incorporated under the Companies Act.\nThey cannot claim wages pay 663 able to their counterparts in government service.\n[668C] Meva Ram Kanojia vs All India Institute of Medical Sciences & Anr., ;, referred to.\nRandhir Singh vs Union of India, ;, ex plained.\nThe principle of 'equal pay for equal work'has no mechanical application in every case of similar work.\nNo two jobs by the mere nomenclature or by the volume of work performed can be rated as equal.\nIt is not just a comparison of physical activity.\nIt requires the consideration of various dimensions of the job.\nThe accuracy required by the job and the dexterity it entails may differ from job to job.\nIt cannot be evaluated by the mere averments in the self serving affidavits or counter affidavits of the parties.\nIt must be left to be evaluated and determined by expert body.\n[666D, 668D E] In the instant case,\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInput: ivil Appeal

Ltd. It has its factory at, inter alia, Visakhapatnam.\nThere it manufactures and sells fusel oil/Styrene Monomer falling under Tariff Item No. 68 of the Ist Schedule to the Act.\nThe case of the appellant is that the said fusel oil is a com pletely manufactured article and after completion of its manufacture, it is stored in storage tanks duly approved for this purpose.\nIt is at this stage that the quantity of fusel oil/Styrene Monomer manufactured, according to the appel lant, is entered in the RG 1 Register maintained for goods manufactured by the appellant.\nIt is also the case of the appellant that the said fusel oil/Styrene Monomer manufac tured by it is sold in bulk and delivered to the customers at the appellant's factory.\nThe fusel oil/Styrene Monomer is also capable of being supplied in road tankers to customers.\nThe appellant had filed its price lists in respect of the same.\nIn the said price lists, which were duly approved by the Asstt.\nCollector, the appellant had shown the value of fusel oil/Styrene Monomer at the rate at which those were sold in wholesale as \"naked Ex Works and in bulk\".\nAccording to the appellant, the manufacture of fusel oil is complete and it is the fully manufactured fusel oil/Styrene Monomer which is stored in the storage tank.\nOn 2nd July, 1983, a notice in respect of a consignment was issued to show cause as to why value of the drums should not be included in the value of the goods.\nThere the drums had been supplied by the buyer.\nAnother show cause notice as to why value of the drums should not be included in the assessable value of the goods, was issued to the appellant on the 5th April, 1983 pertaining to Gate Pass No. 773 whereunder the appellant had cleared 2.4 KI of fusel oil in drums supplied by the buyer.\nReplies were duly filed to the said show cause notices by the appellant contending, inter alia, that as the drums were supplied by the buyer, value thereof could not be included in the assessable value.\nOn the 11th August, 1983, two orders were passed by the Assist ant Collector one in relation to each of the aforesaid show cause notices.\nThe Assistant Collector included the value of the drums in the assessable value of the said fusel oil/Styrene Monomer.\nAppeals were filed by the assessee.\nThe same were allowed by the Collector (Appeals).\nHe held that the appellant had not collected any amount in excess of the amount indicated in the price lists.\nTherefore, in addition 980 to this amount, according to the Collector (Appeals), it was not open to the Asstt.\nCollector to inflate the assessable value without establishing the receipt of the additional consideration by the appellant apart from what had been shown in the invoice.\nThere was a further appeal to the Tribunal.\nThe Tribunal held that at the time of removal the goods were delivered from the factory in packed condition and the containers were not returnable by the buyer, there fore, the value had to be included in the assessable value.\nThe Tribunal, therefore, accepted the revenue's contention and restored the order of the Asst.\nCollector.\nAggrieved therefrom, the appellant has come up in these appeals to this Court.\nOn behalf of the appellant, Shri Salve has contended that the Tribunal erred in law in taking the view that the goods were packed and supplied in drums by the buyer.\nThe Tribunal further observed that in absence of any evidence regarding the resale of the drums by the buyer, the goods were supplied in packed condition by the assessee.\nShri Salve has also contended that in any case, even if the drums were supplied by the buyer, the value thereof should not have been included in the assessable value.\nShri Salve further contended that in any case, even if the drums were supplied by the buyer, the value thereof should not have been included in the assessable value.\nShri Salve further contended that the Tribunal should have considered the fact that the

under Tariff Item No. 68 of the 1st Schedule to the.\nThe said fusel oil/styrene Monomer is sold in bulk and generally delivered to the customers at the appellant's factory in road tankers.\nSome times it is supplied in drums brought by the customers who are not charged anything for those drums.\nIn the case of Styrene Monomer, the finding is that the supply was in tankers to the extent of 90% and only 10% of the sales were made in drums.\nTwo notices were issued to the appellant to show cause as to why the value of the drums should not be included in the assessable value of the goods.\nIn reply, the appellant contended that as the drums were supplied by the buyer the value thereof could not be included in the assessable value.\nThe Assistant Collector however included the value of the drums in the assessable value of the said fusel oil/Styrene Monomer.\nThe Collector (Appeals) allowed the appellant's appeal and held that it was not open to the Assistant Col lector to inflate the assessable value without establishing the receipt of the additional consideration by the appellant apart from what had been shown in the invoice.\nThe Customs, Excise and Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal allowed the further appeal filed by the Revenue and held that at the time of removal the goods were delivered from the factory in packed condition and the containers were not returnable by

it was sold in the wholesale market at the factory.\ngate which could be includ ed in the assessable value of the article; fusel oil/Styrene Monomer was sold in bulk and was capable of being so sold, hence it was not necessary for the said fusel oil/Styrene Monomer to be supplied to the customer in drums; the duty of excise was payable on manufactured goods and no duty of excise could be collected

The Government of India issued a scheme for the benefit of ex military officials.\nThe State of Uttar Pradesh also adopted the same scheme.\nUnder that scheme the ex military officials were appointed on Contract basis for a fixed term which could be extended from time to time subject to the suitability of the official concerned but not beyond 58 years of age.\nPursuant to the said scheme the State of Uttar Pradesh appointed the respondent as the Secretary, Zila Sainik Board, Unnao on 20th of August, 1979.\nParagraph 2 of the said order of appointment issued on 20th August, 1979 reads thus: \"The appointment shah be on contract for a period of one 241 year w.e.f.\nthe date of assumption if it is not terminated earlier by giving a one month's notice by the Hon 'ble Gover nor or on paying one month's salary in lieu thereof or by giving one month's notice, by the Officer.\n\" The respondent was required to furnish his acceptance of the terms and conditions contained in the said order includ ing the above term relating to the period of appointment and on his accepting the terms and conditions he was appointed as the Secretary in the District Soldiers Board in the district of Unnao in the State of Uttar Pradesh '.\nThe said term was extended retrospectively, first upto 20th August, 1982 by an order passed in September, 1981 and it 'was again extended upto 31st March, 1983 by an order made in February, 1983.\nAgain the term was extended upto 30th of August, 1985 by an order dated 1st June, 1983.\nAll these orders of exten sion were couched almost in the same language.\nThe relevant part of the last of such orders, namely, the order dated 1st June, 1983 reads as follows: \"Sir, With reference to your letter No. 1020/Sa.\nA.D.M./141, Dated 31.3.1982 on the above subject I am directed to say that the terms of the officers mentioned under para 2 who were appointed w.e.f.\nthe date mentioned in para 4 (has expired).\nThe Governor is therefore pleased to accord his

is completing earlier during the extended period.\nNo. Name and Date of Date of Recommen place of appoint expiry dation appoint ment of con extend ment tract the contract 1to 12 13 Ex Pilot 21.8.79

Order.\nLetters of accept ance of relevant conditions of service to be obtained from these officers must be submitted to the Government at an early date.\n\" It is thus seen that the appointment of the respondent was indisputably in the nature of contract and under the last order of appointment refened to above he was entitled to continue in office in the post in question till 30th of August, 1985 and not beyond that date unless there was a further extension.\nBut on 29.3.1985 the service of the 1st Respondent was terminated by the issue of a notice and payment of one month's salary.\nThe order was to be effective from the date of receipt of termination order and no charges were men tioned therein against the 1st respondent.\nThe respondent aggrieved by the said order of termina tion filed a Writ Petition on the file of the High Court of Allahabad in Writ Petition No. 3 164 of 1985.\nA Division Bench of the High Court found that the order of termination that had been served on the respondent was an invalid one since it had been issued on the basis of Vigilance Report and no opportunity had been given to the respondent to show cause why such action should not be taken against him.\nHence, the Division Bench set aside the order of termination and directed the 1st respondent to be reinstated in his post of Secretary, Zila Sainik Board, Unnao.\nIt was this order of the Division Bench that the 2nd respondent challenged before this Court.\nThe 2nd respondent argued that the Division Bench of the High Court had no jurisdiction to pass such an order and that, therefore, the said order was bad in law and must be set aside.\nIt was further argued by the 2nd respondent that the Division Bench had erred in law in holding that the order of termination of the respondent was an invalid one.\nThe Division Bench had held that the order of termination was invalid since the reason for the termination had been based on a Vigilance Report which had not been approved by the Governor.\nThe 2nd respondent argued that the Division Bench had not considered the fact that the respondent was an ex military official and that the terms and conditions of his appointment as a Secretary to the Zila Sainik Board, Unnao were governed by the contract of appointment dated 20th August, 1982.\nThe 2nd respondent argued that the Division Bench had erred in law in holding that the order of termination was invalid.\nIn our opinion, the Division Bench of the High Court had clearly erred in law in holding that the order of termination was an invalid one.\nThe Division Bench should have considered the terms and conditions of the contract of appointment which were mentioned in the order of appointment dated 20th August, 1982 and not the reasons for termination as mentioned in the Vigilance Report.\nThe Division Bench should have also considered that the respondent was an ex military official and that his appointment was governed by the contract of appointment which did not provide for termination of employment in the manner in which the 1st respondent had done.\nThe Division Bench should have also considered that the respondent was not charged with any misconduct and that the order of termination was issued on the basis of a Vigilance Report which was not approved by the Governor.\nWe, therefore, allow the Review Application No. 27(W) of 1988 filed by the 2nd respondent and set aside the order of the Division Bench of the High Court.\nThe order of termination of the 1st respondent as Secretary to the Zila Sainik Board, Unnao is upheld and the 1st respondent is not entitled to be reinstated in the post of Secretary\nActual: Pursuant to a scheme enacted for the benefit of ex military officials the appellant State appointed the re spondent on 20.8.1979 as Secretary Zila Sainik Board on contract basis for a specified period which was further extended upto 30.8.1985.\nOn 29.3.1985 the services of the respondent were terminated.\nThe respondent filed a writ petition before the High Court challenging the termination order.\nBy an order dated 24.3.1988 the High Court set aside the termination order holding that the respondent was entitled to salary upto the period he was entitled to remain in service i.e. upto 30.8.1985.\nThe respondent preferred a Review Petition before the High Court contending that pursuant to the interim order dated 10.7.1986 passed by the High Court he was entitled to be reinstated in service even though there was no order of extension of service.\nBy an order dated 26.7.1988, the High Court allowed the Review Petition directing the appellant State to reinstate the respondent in service.\nHence this appeal by the State.\nAllowing the appeal and setting aside the order passed on Review, this Court, HELD: 1.\nIn the instant case, the appointment of the respondent was indisputably in the nature of contract and under tile order of appointment he was entitled to continue in office in the post in question till 30th of August, 1985 and not beyond that date unless there was a further exten sion.\nSince no order of extension had been sanctioned by 240 the Governor beyond 30th August, 1985 the respondent was entitled to the salary and allowances due to him till 30th of August, 1985 if tile order of termination of service was found to be an invalid one.\n[242B; 244C] 1.1 The High Court was right in disposing of the Writ Petition on 24.3.1988 declaring that the respondent was entitled to salary upto the period he was entitled to remain in service, i.e. 30th August, 1985.\nBut it was not right in making an order on Review on 26.7.1988 relying upon the interim order dated 10.7.1986 which'in the circumstances could not have the effect of controlling the jurisdiction of the High Court to dispose of the Writ Petition on merits as it did on 24.3.1988.\n[\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInput: etition (Civil) Nos.\n12676 77 of 1985

Gujarat on June 26, 1985 in exercise of its powers conferred by Section 15 of the (67 of 1957), herein after referred to as the Act, amending the Gujarat Minor Mineral Rules 1966, hereinafter referred to as the Rules, with effect from 1 7 1985 substituting the original rule 21 of the Rules by a new rule which reads as follows: \"21.\nRate of Royality: The holder of a quarry lease or any other mineral concession granted under these rules shall pay royalty in respect of minor minerals, specified in column 2 of the schedule, removed or consumed by him or by his agent, manager, employee,

ignored\" and fixing the royalty payable by the lessees in respect of minor minerals known as Black Trap and Hard Murrum at Rs.7 per metric tonne by amending schedule of the Rules which was being levied at Rs. 4 till the date of the said amendment.\n409 In order to understand the case of the petitioners it is necessary to set out some other provisions of law governing the case.\nThe Act was passed in the year 1957 by Parliament to provide for the regulation of mines and development of minerals under the control of the Union and it was made applicable to the whole of India.\nUnder section 3A of the Act the word'minerals'is defined as including all minerals except mineral oils.\nClause (e) of the said section defines'minor minerals'as building stones, gravel, ordinary clay, ordinary sand other than sand used for prescribed purposes and any other mineral which the Central Government may.\nby notification in the Official Gazette, declare to be a minor mineral.\nIt is not disputed that Black Trap and Hard Murrum are notified as minor minerals.\nThe Act has made provision with regard to the issue of prospecting licences and mining leases in respect of various kinds of minerals other than minor minerals and the procedure to be followed in that connection in the matter of issue of prospecting licences and mining leases.\nSection 9 of the act empowers the Central Government to levy royalty in respect of the minerals which are won by the mining lease holders under the Act at the rates prescribed in the Second Schedule to the Act.\nIt empowers the Central Government to enhance or reduce the rate of royalty prescribed by the Second Schedule in respect of any mineral subject to the condition that the Central Government shall not enhance the rate of royalty in respect of any mineral more than once during any period of three years.\nSection 14 of the Act provides that sections 5 to 13 (inclusive) shall not apply to quarry leases, mining leases or other mineral concessions in respect of minor minerals.\nSection 15 as it stood during the relevant time read thus: \"15.\n(1) The State Government may, by notifi cation in the Official Gazette, make rules for regulating the grant of (quarry leases, mining leases or other mineral concessions) in re spect of minor minerals and for purposes connected therewith.\n(2) Until rules are made under sub section (1), my rules made by a State Government regulating the grant of (quarry leases, mining leases or other mineral concessions) in re spect of minor minerals which are in force immediately before the commencement of this Act shall continue in force.\n(3) The holder of a mining lease or any other mineral concession granted under any rule made under sub section (1) 410 shall pay royalty or dead rent, whichever is more in respect of minor minerals removed or consumed by him or by his agent, manager, employee, contractor or sub lessee from the leased area at the rate specified in the said rules.\n(4) The holder of a quarry lease or any other mineral concession granted under any rule made under sub section (1) shall pay royalty or dead rent, whichever is more in respect of minor minerals removed or consumed by him or by his agent, manager, employee, contractor or sub lessee from the leased area at the rate specified in the said rules.\n(5) (i) The holder of a Parwana granted under any rule made under sub section (1) shall pay royalty at the rate of fifty percent of the rate of royalty specified in the said rules.\n(ii) no royalty shall be charged from Nimbha das of village potters who manufacture upto one lakh bricks per year.\n(iii) no royalty shall be charged from Nimbha das of village potters if their annual production is not exceeding two lakhs bricks and they supply at least one lakh bricks to the Rural Housing Board or Panchayats.\n(6) Until the rules are made under sub section (1) no royalty shall be payable by the holder of a quarry lease or any

rules.\n(8) (i) The holder of a Parwana granted under any rule made under sub section (1) or sub section (2) shall be entitled to recover any amount of royalty paid by him in respect of minor minerals removed or consumed by him or by his agent, manager, employee, contractor or sub lessee from the leased area at the rate specified in the said rules.\n(ii) no amount of royalty paid by the holder of a Parwana granted under any rule made under sub section (1) or sub section (2) shall be recoverable in respect of minor minerals removed or consumed by him or by his agent, manager, employee, contractor

Rules were amended with effect from 1.7.1985.\nBy the said notification, original Rule 21 of the Rules was substituted by a new Rule 21 which provided that a holder of a quarry lease or any other mineral concession granted under the Rules shall pay royalty in respect of minor minerals provid ed in column 2 of the Schedule.\nIt is under this Notifica tion that the rate of royalty in respect of Black trap and Hard Murrum was increased from Rs.4 to Rs. 7 per metric tonne.\nThe validity of Rule 21 as it stood prior to its amend ment by the aforesaid impugned notification was considered and upheld by this Court on March 6, 1986 in D.K. Trivedi & Sons & Ors.\nvs State of Gujarat & Ors.\n, ; The impugned notification was issued at a time when the Writ Petitions in the aforesaid case were pending in the High Court.\nThe increase in the levy of royalty effected by the impugned notification is now questioned in these petitions.\nThe Petitioners raised the following contentions viz; (1) That the royalty levied and covered under the Rules should be applied only for mineral development and since the royalty is being treated as part of the consolidated fund of the State and used for other purposes by the State, the levy was bad; and (2) That the impugned notification in question was in contravention of clause (c) of article 304 of the constitution.\n(3) That the impugned notification is discriminatory in character.\n407 Dismissing the Writ Petitions, this Court, HELD: That Act is no doubt passed for development of minerals but while discharging its functions relating to development, if the State incidentally allows mining to be carried on in the public interest and levies in that connec tion a tax, it does not mean that the said tax should be used only for development of minerals and not for other purposes sanctioned by law.\n[412B] The India Cement Ltd. etc.\nvs The State of Tamil Nadu etc., [1989] 4 SC Judgment Today 190.\nNo restriction is being imposed on the freedom of trade of the petitioners by the levy of royalty.\nThe minerals belong to the Government and if anybody wants to have the right as\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInput: : Criminal Appeal No. 8 18 of 1979.\nFrom the Judgment & Order dated the 27.10.1979 of the Madras High Court in Crl.\nA.

J. and Venkatarama Aiyar J. by an order dated July 10, 1953, dismissed the applications.\nThe learned Judges held that section 5(4)(a) of the Act was void to the extent it conferred on the Collector authority to refuse a licence at his own discretion and rule 37 was void in so far as it prohibited persons whose names had not yet been registered as buyers and sellers, from carrying on business in the notified area.\nSubject to that, the impugned Act and the Rules were upheld under article 19(6) of the Constitution as a valid piece of marketing legislation.\nIn the result, the applications were dismissed.\nThe aforesaid three appellants have filed these appeals against the order of the High Court in so far as it dismissed their applications.\nLearned counsel for the appellants contend that the provisions of the Act and the Rules were not valid under Article 19(6) of the Constitution and that the impugned order is illegal and, therefore, the High Court was justified in issuing the Writ of Mandamus.\nOn the other hand, the respondents (State of Madras, the Collectors of the concerned Districts and the Chairmen of the Market Committees) have submitted that the provisions of the Act and the Rules were valid under Article 19(6) of the Constitution and that the impugned order of the High Court was illegal.\nIt is not necessary to consider the validity of the provisions of the Act and the Rules under Article 19(6) of the Constitution in these appeals.\nThe question for consideration in these appeals is whether the High Court was justified in issuing the Writ of Mandamus against the respondents and if so, to what extent.\nIn order to determine this question, it must be seen whether the High Court had the power to issue the Writ of Mandamus against the respondents and whether the impugned order was justified.\nSection 5(4)(a) of the Act confers on the Collector the power to refuse a licence at his own discretion. This provision is hit by Article 14 of the Constitution, which provides that no person shall be subjected to capricious or arbitrary action by the State.\nHowever, the provision of Article 14 is qualified by Article 19(6) of the Constitution which permits the State to enact laws with a view to securing the orderly conduct of economic life, subject to the restrictions contained in clauses (2) and (3) of Article 19.\nThe question, therefore, is whether the provision of section 5(4)(a) of the Act, while conferring on the Collector the power to refuse a licence, infringes Article 14 of the Constitution and is, therefore, hit by Article 19(6) of the Constitution.\nThe provision of section 5(4)(a) of the Act is hit by Article 14 of the Constitution.\nThe provision of section 5(4)(a) of the Act is hit by Article 14 of the Constitution.\nArticle 14 of the Constitution is hit by the provision of section 5(4)(a) of the Act.\nThe provision of section 5(4)(a) of the Act is hit by Article 14 of the Constitution.\nArticle 14 of the Constitution is hit by the provision of section 5(4\nActual: The Madras legislature enacted the Madras Commercial Crops Markets Act for providing satisfactory conditions for the growers of commercial crops to sell their produce on equal terms with the purchasers and at reasonable prices.\nThe Act, Rules and the Bye laws framed thereunder have a long term target of providing a net work of markets wherein facilities for correct weighment are ensured, storage accommodation is provided, and reliable market information is given.\nTill such markets are established the Act provides for the imposition of licensing restrictions to enable the buyers and sellers to meet in licensed premises.\nAfter the establishment of the markets no licenses would be issued within a reasonable radius from the markets and all growers will have to resort to the markets for selling their crops.\nThe result would be to eliminate, as far as possible, the middlemen and to give reasonable facilities for the growers of commercial crops to secure best prices for their commodities.\nHeld, that the impugned provisions of the Act impose reasonable restrictions on the citizen's right to do business and are valid.\nSuch a statute cannot be said to create unreasonable restrictions on the citizen's right to do business unless it is clearly established that the provisions are too drastic, unnecessarily harsh and over reach the object for which they were made.\nChintaman Rao vs The State of Madhya Pradesh, [1950] S.C.R. 759 and State of Madras vs V.

In 1956, the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) stepped into the shoes of these two insurance companies and became the owner of the property.\nOn 20.7.65, the LIC moved two applications (being HRC Nos. 3310 and 3311 of 1965) in the court of the Rent Con troller (Sri A. Varadarajan who later became a Judge of the this Court) for fixation of a \"fair rent\" for each of the premises.\nThe fair rent claimed was computed at Rs.2,399.03 per month in respect of item No. 1 as against the rent of Rs. 150 p.m. fixed under the lease deed.\nIn respect of item 2 the fair rent claimed was Rs.3266.50 as against Rs.200 p.m. payable under the lease deed.\nThe defendants (G.G. and his sons) filed their objections to the above applications.\nThey claimed that, under both the lease deeds, what had been leased out to them was only a vacant land and that the superstructure had been built by them.\nThey claimed, there fore, that they were entitled to relief under the Madras 550 City Tenants'Protection Act and that the Rent Controller Court had no jurisdiction to fix a fair rent.\nThe Rent Controller accepted the.above argument so far as item was concerned.\nSo far as item 2 was concerned, it appears that, at the time of the hearing, it was conceded before the Rent Controller that the respondents were tenants of the entire properties covered by the lease deed and that they had not constructed any of the premises thereupon.\nIn view of this the Rent Controller dismissed H.R.C. 3310/ 65 relating to item No. 1 and, in H.R.C. 3311/65, fixed the fair rent in respect of item No. 2 at Rs. 1451 p.m.\nThe order of the Rent Controller was dated 9.3.\nThere were appeals to the Court of Small Causes.\nIn respect of item No. 1, in H.R.A. 534/66, the Court, on a perusal of the sale deed dated 30.7.53 filed by the LIC before it, came to the conclusion that the buildings on the land leased under exhibit P 1 had also been conveyed to the LIC and that the LIC was entitled to seek fixation of fair rent in respect of this premises also.\nThe fair rent fixed by the Rent Controller at Rs.994 p.m. was upheld.\nThe order of the Rent Controller in respect of item 2 was upheld in H.R.A. 535/66.\nIn respect of item 2, the Court observed that the co owners had leased out the property in its bare form without any buildings and that the respondents were the tenants of the entire property.\nThe appeal was dismissed.\nHence, this appeal.\nThe main contention of the respondents is that the Rent Controller and the Court of Small Causes below had erred in holding that the buildings constructed by the respondents on the leased premises were not part of the premises leased and that the respondents were entitled to relief under the Madras City Tenants Protection Act.\nIt is the contention of the respondents that the Madras City Tenants Protection Act, 1947 was enacted with the primary intention of protecting the interests of tenants and that the Act was not intended to be applied to cases where the buildings constructed by the tenants on the leased premises were not part of the premises leased.\nTherefore, the contention of the respondents is that the Rent Controller and the Court of Small Causes below were wrong in holding that the buildings constructed by the respondents on the leased premises were not part of the premises leased and that the respondents were entitled to relief under the Madras City Tenants Protection Act.\nOn the other hand, the contention of the appellants is that the Madras City Tenants Protection Act was not intended to be applied to cases where the buildings constructed by the tenants on the leased premises were not part of the premises leased and that the Rent Controller and the Court of Small Causes below were right in holding that the buildings constructed by the respondents on the leased premises were not part of the premises leased and that the respondents were not entitled to relief under the Madras City Tenants Protection Act.\nThe question that falls for consideration in this appeal is whether the buildings constructed by the respondents on the leased premises were part of the premises leased and whether the respondents are entitled to relief under the Madras City Tenants Protection Act.\nThe Madras City Tenants Protection Act, 1947 was enacted by the State Legislature of Tamil Nadu with the intent to protect the interests of tenants in the city of Madras.\nSection 3 of the said Act, which is the relevant section, provides that where any tenant in possession of a building or part of a building is not satisfied with the rent or with the terms and conditions of the tenancy, he may apply to the Rent Controller for fixation of a fair rent.\nSection 3 of the Act also provides that where any dispute arises as to whether any building or part of a building is comprised in the premises\nActual: Two separate properties bearing Door Nos. 2 and 3 ad measuring 41 grounds and 2005 sq. ft., which originally formed part of an extent of land, situate at Mount Road, Madras belonged to several co owners, who leased out the same to the Respondent, by two separate lease deeds (exhibit P 1 and P 2) item 1 and 2 in the Schedule A to the plaint.\nThe property contained in Door No. 2 which comprised an area of 4 grounds and 151 sq ft with certain buildings was given on rent for Rs. 150 p.m., whereas the property contained in Door No. 3 which also had some buildings thereon was let out for Rs.200 p.m.\nThe owners sold the properties to the United India Life Assurance Co. and the New Guardian of India Life Insurance Co. Ltd. in July 1953.\nIn 1956, the Life Insurance Corpora tion of India, the appellant stepped into the shoes of the said companies The appellant moved two applications before the Rent Controller for fixation of a 'fair rent'for each of the premises; In respect of the property in Door No. 2, the rent claimed was Rs.2,399/03 while in respect of the other, the rent claimed was Rs.3266/50p.\nThe tenants claimed that, under both the lease deeds, what had been leased out to them was only a vacant land and since the superstructure had been built by them, they were entitled to relief under the Madras City Tenants'Protection Act.\nIt was further contended that the Rent Controller had no jurisdiction to fix a fair rent.\nThe Rent Controller accepted the contention of the tenant so far as item No. 1 (property at Door No. 2) was concerned but with regard to the second property (Door No. 3), he fixed the fair rent at Rs. 1451 p.m.\nThere were then two appeals to the Court of Small Causes.\nThe Small Causes Court came to the conclusion that the buildings on the land leased vide P 1 had also been conveyed to the appellant and that the LIC was entitled to seek fixation of fair rent in respect of this premises also.\nHowever the order of the Rent Controller in regard to the 546 other property in Door No. 3 was upheld.\nHowever, in certain earlier proceedings for fixation of fair rent etc., it had been held by the Rent Controller that item No. (Door No. 2) belonged\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInput: il Appeal No.18 of 1955.\nAppeal from the judgment and decree dated March 20, 1651, of the Mysore High Court in R.A.

have been filed directly in this Court in view of a learned single Judge of the High Court having decided the issue against the assessees as early as 25.11.\n1980 in C.W.P. 1227/80, which was also affirmed by a Division Bench later 2.\nThe Act is a much amended one and Some of its provi sions have been recently amended with retrospective effect from 27th May, 1971 a point of time when actually a prede cessor Act (the Punjab General Sales Tax Act, 1948) had been in force.\nThe provisions of the statute, relevant for our purpose, and their relevant amendments may be noticed first: 347 1.\nSection 2(e) (a) Originally section 2(e) defined 'export'to mean \"the taking out of goods from the State to any place outside it otherwise than by way of sale in the course of inter State trade or commerce.\n\" (b) Act 44 of 1976, added, at the end of the above definition, the following words w.e.f.\n1.4.1976: \"or in the course of export out of the territory of India.\nSection 2(p) (a) section 2(p) defined the expression 'turnover'as includ ing \"the aggregate of the amounts of the sales and purchases.. made by any dealer\" in any capacity during a given period.\nExplanation 2 to the second defini tion provided: \"(2) The proceeds of the sale of any goods on the purchase of which tax is leviable under this Act or the purchase value of any goods on the sales of which tax is leviable under this Act, shall not be included in the turnover, but the purchase value of the goods liable to tax under section 9 shall be included.\n\" (b) Act 13 of 1989 amended the Explanation by inserting, in it, after the words \"section 9\", the words \"or section 24\".\n(c) Act 1 of 1990 has amended the above Explanation retrospectively to say that the words \"but the purchase value of the goods liable to tax under section 9 or section 24 shall be included\" shall be omitted and shall be deemed always to have been omitted with effect from 27.5.\nSo we have to proceed on the basis that the underlined words never were there in el.\n(p) of section 2.\nThe 1990 Act also inserted an Explanation 6 to the clause w.e.f. 31.3.\n1983 which reads: \"(6) The purchase of barley or of goods used in the manufac ture of guar gum, scientific goods, utensils and metal handicrafts shall not form part of the turnover of a dealer for the period he is entitled to purchase the goods on the authority of his certificate of registration without payment of sales tax under section 24, provided these are used exclusively for the specified purposes.\n\" 348 111.\nSection 6(1) (a) Originally defined 'purchase'to mean \"the receipt of goods by a dealer from any person, for cash or by barter, on the faith of a bill of lading, receipt, or other document of title.\n(b) Act 44 of 1976 amended the definition by adding the words \"or on the faith of any document of title\" w.e.f.\n1.4.1976.\n(c) Act 13 of 1989 amended the definition by adding the words \"or on the faith of any document of title or any bill of lading or receipt\" w.e.f.\n1.4.1989.\n(d) Act 1 of 1990 amended the definition in clause (a) to read: \"purchase\" means \"the receipt of goods by a dealer from any person, for cash, by barter, on the faith of a bill of lading, receipt, or any document of title or any other document, for the purpose of using such goods in the course of the business of the dealer, or for the purpose of using such goods in the manufacture of goods or in the manufacture of goods for resale or for resale in the course of inter-State trade or commerce.\n\" (e) Act 1 of 1990 also amended the Explanation to the definition of purchase to read: \"(Explanation) The purchase of goods by a dealer for resale in the course of inter State trade or commerce, shall be deemed to be made for the purposes of the business of the dealer or for the purpose of manufacturing goods for resale or for resale in the course of inter-State trade or commerce.\n\" (f) Section 9(1) (a) of the Act originally read: \"Where any dealer purchases goods from any person for resale in the course of inter-State trade or commerce, he shall pay to the tax authority, the tax on the sale price of such goods at the rate applicable in the place of supply of such goods, as determined by the tax authority.\n\" (b) Act 13 of 1989 amended the section to read: \"Where any dealer purchases goods from any person for resale in the course of inter-State trade or commerce, he shall pay to the tax authority, the tax on the sale price of such goods at the rate applicable in the place of supply of such goods, as determined by the tax authority, provided that the dealer has purchased the goods without paying tax on the sale price of such goods, as determined by the tax authority.\n\" \nActual: Each of the appellants/petitioners is a registered dealer in the State of Haryana.\nHe purchased certain raw materials in the State without paying purchase tax thereon, in view of the provision contained in section 24 of the Haryana Sales Tax Act, 1973.\nHe manufactured certain goods in the State with the aid of the said raw materials.\nHe then sold the manufactured goods to dealers who, in turn, export ed those goods out of India.\nOn these facts the assessee claimed that he was not liable to pay the purchase tax on the raw materials, imposed under section 9(1) of the Sales Tax Act.\nThe Department denied the relief on the short ground that the sales effected by the appellants were not sales in the course of export outside India within the meaning of section 5(1) of the.\nAc cording to the Department, they were only \"penultimate\" sales, which may be deemed to be 'export sales'because of the fiction created under section 5(3) of the C.S. Act 1956, but that was not enough to escape from the clutches of the charge in section 9(1).\nAccordingly, the claim of the asses see was rejected by the taxing authorities.\nThe High Court also rejected the assessee's petition.\nBefore this Court, it was contended on behalf of the assessees that the effect of section 5(3) of the C.S.T. Act was to expand the scope of section 5(1) and include within the concept of sales in the course of export outside India also the 'penultimate'sales; that a reference to, and the meaning of, section 5(1) could not be understood without a reference to section 5(3); and that as a result of section 5(3), such penultimate sales became export sales falling beyond the purview and competence of State legislature.\nIt was further submitted that purchases of 344 raw material used in the manufacture of goods inside the State attracted the tax under section 9(1) unless those manufactured goods were dealt with in one of three ways; (1) disposed of by way of sale inside the State; (2) despatched to a place outside the State but by way of a sale in the course of inter State trade or commerce; or (3) despatched to a place outside the State but by way of sale in the course of export outside the territory of India.\nIn the alternative, it\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInput: it Petition No. 459 & 460 of 1988.\n(Under Article 32 of the Constitution of India).\nHarish N.

Godrej Soaps Pvt. Ltd. & Anr., ; this Court construed the words 'whether canalised or otherwise'contained in the order dated April 18, 1985, passed in Rajnikant Brothers case (supra) and it was observed that the Court would not know whether in the future certain canalised items could be imported directly by an Export House holding an Additional licence and that the possibility of a policy being framed in the future enabling an Export House holding an Additional licence to directly import items which are `non canalised'and also item which are `canalised'could not be ruled out and it was in this light that the Court can be said to have used the words \"whether canalised or otherwise\".\nThe High Court in the said case, after considering the aforesaid decisions of this Court, accepted the contention of the petitioners that the direction given by this Court in the said case must be construed as to mean that the petitioners were entitled to import all items whether canalised or otherwise and that the petitioners were not required to obtain an Additional licence in order to import items which were not banned under the Export Policy 1978 79 and that the petitioners were also entitled to export all items whether cut or polished or otherwise.\nOn the basis of the said construction, the High Court directed the authorities to grant the Export House Certificates to the petitioners under the Import Policy for the year 1978 79 within three months.\n238 The said order was assailed by the respondents and the said assailable order was challenged by the respondents in the Division Bench of the High Court and the said Division Bench of the High Court allowed the appeal of the respondents and set aside the order passed by the Single Judge of the High Court.\nThe Division Bench of the High Court was of the view that the words \"whether canalised or otherwise\" used in the direction given by this Court in the Rajnikant Brothers case (supra) did not mean that the grantees of the Additional licence were entitled to import all items whether canalised or otherwise and that the said words were used to enable the grantees of Additional licence to import items which were not banned under the Export Policy 1978 79, in addition to the items which were banned under the said Policy.\nThe Division Bench of the High Court also held that the grantees of the Additional licence were still bound by the conditions of the Additional licence, in particular, the condition of para 176(10) of the Import Policy 1978 79, which stated that the grantees of Additional licence could import items which were not banned under the Export Policy 1978 79, in addition to the items which were banned under the said Policy, but the grantees of Additional licence were not entitled to import all items whether canalised or otherwise.\nThe Division Bench of the High Court, therefore, set aside the order passed by the Single Judge of the High Court and directed the petitioners to pay the cost of the appeal and to vacate the premises of the respondents.\nThe said Division Bench order was assailed by the petitioners and the said assailable order was challenged in this Court by means of these two writ petitions.\nIn the present case,\nActual: The petitioners, carrying,on import export of diamonds, field applications for registration as Export Houses and grant of Additional Import Licences under Para 174 and 176 of the Import and Export Policy 1978 79 which were rejected by the authorities on the ground that they have failed to diversify their exports of \"other products\" during the year 1977 78.\nThey challenged the order of the authorities by filing writ petitions before the Bombay High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution.\nOne of the petitions was dismissed by a learned single judge of the High Court and the said petitions filed an appeal before a Division Bench of the High Court.\nDuring the pendency of the appeal 233 and the writ petition,the Supreme Court by its order dated April 18, 1985 decided the case of Union of India vs Rajnikant Bros. holding that there was no requirement of diversification of exports as a condition for the grant of Export Houses Certificates in the Import Export Policy for the year 1978 79 but the grantee of Additional Licences were not only prohibited from importing items which were excluded in the Export Policy 1978 79 but also from importing items excluded under the Import Policy prevailing at the time import.\nThe High Court decided the cases of the petitioners in accordance with the decision of this Court in Union of India vs Rajnikant Bros. Purusant to the decision of the Bombay High Court petitioners were granted Export House Certificates and Additional Import Licences which were valid for 12 months, with the same condition as provided by this Court in its order dated April18, 1985 in the case of Rajnikant.\nHowever, the petitioners were not able to make imports under the said licences till 31st March,1988.On 1.4.1988, the Government of India issued a revised Export and Import Policy for the period 1988 91.Under Para 215 of the said revised policy certain flexibilities were granted in the matter of imports to the grantees of Additional Import Licences.\nHowever, under para 218(10) of the said revised Policy the holdersof the Additional Import Licences issuedprior to 1.4.1988 were made ineligible for the benefit of flexibilities in import as contained in para 215(4).\nSince,the petitioners were holding licences issued prior to 1.4.1988 they could not avail the flexibilities in import as contained in Para 215 of the 1988 91 Policy.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInput: ivil Misc.\nPetition No. 15001 of 1989.\nAND I.A.

The fact that the property is transferred to the third parties by way of subsequent sale deeds is not a ground for rejecting the actability of the compromise.\nWe, therefore, hold that the compromise is actuable and the second respondent's contention that the property is already transferred is without merit.\nIn view of the fact that the property is transferred to third parties, the question of the actability of the compromise is to be answered on the basis of the terms of the compromise and the parties to the compromise.\nThe compromise stipulated that respondent No. 2 shall relinquish his interest in the property on receipt of Rs. 1 lakh.\nHowever, since the payment of Rs. 1 lakh has not been made by the father, respondent No. 2 has a right to dispute the fact of the compromise.\nTherefore, the compromise is not actuable in the present case.\nWe, therefore, direct the following:\nThe compromise in the present case is not actuable.\nThe third parties who have been made the owners of the property by virtue of the subsequent sale deeds are not the parties to the compromise.\nThe second respondent shall continue to be the owner of the property.\nThe father shall be entitled to recover the amount of Rs. 1 lakh from the second respondent and shall also be entitled to claim a decree for specific performance of the terms of the compromise in respect of relinquishing the interest in the property.\nThe father shall also be entitled to claim a decree for the injunction.\nThe second respondent shall pay the costs of the special leave petition.\nThe third parties shall pay the costs of the special leave petition.\nWe make the following directions: The second respondent shall give up the property within three months from the date of this order.\nIf the second respondent fails to give up the property within the aforesaid period of three months, the father shall be entitled to seek possession of the property by a suit or any other legal remedy available to him.\nThe father shall also be entitled to claim damages for the delay in relinquishing the interest in the property.\nThe father shall be entitled to recover the amount of Rs. 1 lakh from the second respondent as a part of the costs of the special leave petition.\nThe father shall be entitled to claim a decree for specific performance of\nActual: Respondent No. 1 adopted petitioner appellant, who married two wives and through the first wife he had a son, the respondent No. 2 and through the second, another son, the respondent No. 3.\nDuring the pendency of the special leave petition the adoptive mother of appellant died.\nRespondent 2 and 3 laid claim to the entire property of respondent No. 1 exclusively under two different wills said to be by the respondent No. 1 and each contended that the other will was a forged one.\nOn the death of the adoptive mother, the appellant laid claim to her entire property as heir.\nWhile each of the parties had taken such stand, in the litigation a compromise was brought about on 21.8.1987 between the appellant and his two sons, the respondents 2 and 3 and the same was filed in this Court and in terms of the compromise the appellant, to make payment of Rs. 1 lakh to each of his two sons in lieu of relinquishment of their interest.\nWhen the matter was listed for recording the compromise, the respondent No. 2 contended that as he had not been paid Rs. 1 lakh as stipulated in the compromise, in the meanwhile he had alienated about 81 acres of the suit properties to the third parties.\nThe alienees had been also impleaded as parties under the orders of this Court.\nDisposing of the petition, this Court, HELD: 1.\nOnce the Court was satisfied that there was a compromise it was for the Court to record the same and no option lay before the Court to act otherwise.\n[542A B] 539 2.\nAs the compromise petition in the instant case is genuine nd lawful the same has to be acted upon.\n[542B] 3.\nIt is directed that the compromise petition shall be accepted and in terms thereof the suit shall be disposed of and the terms of the compromise shall form part of the order to be drawn up in this Court for disposing of the special leave petition.\n[542B C] 4.\nWith a view to settling all equities between the parties, directed that the appellant to pay a sum of Rs.1 lakh more to respondent No. 2 within eight weeks.\nRs. 77,124 being the amount paid by the alienees before the Sub Registrar in respect of the sale deeds shall be deposited.\n[542C E] 5.\nThe alienees have no right created under the alleged sale deeds\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInput: Special Leave Petition Nos.\n823 24 of 1990.\nFrom the Judgement and Order dated 6.10.1989 of the Karnataka High Court W.A.

Nos. 823 and 824 of 1990 against the decision of the Devision Bench of that High Court, and obtained an interim stay of dispossession therein.\nWhatever the ultimate effect of the stay orders, in view of the provisions of Section 11 A of the Land Acquisition Act, to which we have already referred 566 earlier, it is beyond dispute that the fact of the stay orders was highly material in the determination of these Special Leave Petitions.\nCuriously enough, there is no reference in the Special Leave Petitions to any to the stay orders and we came to know about these orders only when the respondents appeared in response to the notice and filed their counter affidavit.\nIn our view, the said interim orders have a direct bearing on the question raised and the non disclosure of the same certainly amounts to suppression of material facts.\nOn this ground alone, the Special Leave Petitions are liable to be rejected.\nIt is well settled in law that the relief sought for in a Special Leave Petition is that the High Court should be directed to set aside the judgment and order of the High Court passed in the Writ Petitions.\nIt is also well settled that the facts which are necessary to be disclosed in the affidavit supporting the Special Leave Petition are such facts which are necessary to enable the High Court to pass a just and proper order in the Writ Petition.\nIt is also settled that if any fact necessary to enable the High Court to pass a just and proper order is suppressed, the Special Leave Petition is liable to be rejected.\nIn the case of Ram Nath Kalsawala v. Union of India (1983) 3 SCC 1, it was stated that \"a Special Leave Petition is not a mere appeal from the order of the High Court and in order to be entertained, the High Court must be satisfied that there is an error apparent on the face of record or that there is a mistake or suppression of some material facts in the Writ Petition or in the record on which the Writ Petition was decided. A Special Leave Petition is not a mere appeal against the decision of the High Court and if the High Court is of the view that the Writ Petition does not disclose any error apparent on the face of record or any mistake or suppression of material facts, the High Court is bound to reject the Special Leave Petition. Such rejection of the Special Leave Petition by the High Court is in exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution.\"\nIn view of the above said ratio, we are of the view that the Special Leave Petitions are liable to be rejected.\nThe Special Leave Petitions are rejected for want of merits, for suppression of material facts and for not disclosing facts necessary to enable the High Court to pass a just and proper order in the Writ Petitions.\nThe respondents are directed to pay the costs of these Special Leave Petitions to the petitioners.\nThe Special Leave Petitions are accordingly rejected.\nThe answer to the questions raised in these Special Leave Petitions is as follows:\n(i) The fact that the award was not made within the stipulated time under Section 11A of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, is not in dispute.\n(ii) The fact that the award was not made within two years from the date of the publication of the declaration under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act is not in dispute.\n(iii) The fact that the declaration was made on September 20, 1977\nActual: Petitioners'lands were acquired by the respondents under sections 17 and 19 of the Bangalore Development Act, 1976.\nSection 36 of the said Act made applicable the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, where acquisition is otherwise than by agreement.\nThe notification making the declaration under section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act in respect of the lands in question was made on 20.9.1977.\nOn 20.9.1984s.\n11 A was introduced and brought into force by the Land Acquisition (Amendment) Act, 1984 prescribing that where the declaration under section 4 of the Land Acquisition ACt was published before the commencement of the Land Acquistion (Amendment) Act, 1984, the award was to be made within two years from such commencement.\nThe awards should have thus been made within two years from 20.9.1984.\nOn 11.9.1985 the petitioners obtained an interim order from this Court directing status quo with regard to the possession of the lands in question in a special leave petition which was dismissed on 29.4.87.\non December 16 17,1987 two writ petitions were filed by the petioners in the High Court Challenging the acquisition, contending that as the awards were not made within two years of the notification making the declaration under section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, the entire acquisition proceedings had lapsed.\nThe High Court granted interim stay in respect of the acquisition of the lands.\nThe petitions were later dismissed.\nAppeals therefrom were also dismissed by a Division Bench.\nThe petitioners preferred these special leave petitions and obtained interim stay of dispossession.\nDismissing the special leave petitions, this Court, 564 HELD: 1.\nThe relief under Article 136 of the Constitution is discretionary and a petitioner who approaches this Court for such relief must come with frank and full disclosure of facts.\nIf he fails to do so and suppresses material facts, his application is liable to be dismissed.[566B C] 2.Whatever the ultimate effect of the stay orders, in view of the provisions of section 11 A of the Land Acquisition ACt, the Fact of the stay orders was highly material in the determination of these special leave petitions.\nThere was no reference in the special leave petitions to any of the stay orders and the Court could know about these orders only when the respondents appeared in response to the notice and filed their counter affidavit.\nThe said interim orders\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInput: Criminal Appeal No. 400 of 1979.\nFrom the Judgment and Order dated 27.4.79 of the Madras High Court in Criminal Misc.\nP.

Yet considering the great impor tance of the questions involved in this matter, I deem it just and proper to consider the same and to express my own views.\nThree very important questions fall for decision in this case.\nFirst of all whether a Judge of the Supreme Court or a Judge of a High Court is a public servant within the meaning of Section 2 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947.\nSection 2 of the Prevention of Corruption Act interprets a public servant as meaning a public servant as defined in section 21 of the Indian Penal Code i.e. Act 45 of 1860.\nSection 21 of the Indian Penal Code states that a public servant denotes a person falling under any of the descrip tion mentioned therein: \"Third Every Judge including any person empowered by law to discharge, whether by himself or as a member of any body of persons any adjudicarory functions.\n\" Thus, the definition of a public servant is very wide enough to include Judges of the Supreme Court as well as Judges of the High Court.\nSection 77 of the Indian Penal Code provides immunity to the Judges in respect of any act done by a Judge when acting judicially in the exercise of any power which is, or which in good faith he believes to be, given to him by law.\nThe next question is whether a judge of the Supreme Court or a Judge of High Court including the Chief Justice of the High Court can be prosecuted for having committed the offence of criminal misconduct as referred to in clause (e) of sub section 1 of section 5 of the Prevention of Corrup tion Act, 1947.\nProvisions of clause (e) of section 5(1) are as follows: 217 \"if he or any person on his behalf is in possession or has, at any time during the period of his office, been in possession, for which the public servant cannot satisfactorily account, of pecuniary resources or property disproportionate to his known sources of income.\n\" Therefore, it is clear that a Judge will be liable for committing criminal misconduct within the meaning of clause (e) of sub section (1) of section 5 of the said Act if he has in his possession pecuniary resources or property dis proportionate to his known sources of income for which the public servant (or a Judge as the public servant) cannot satisfactorily account.\nSection 6(1)(c) specifically enjoins that no court shall take cognizance of an offence punishable under Section 5 of this Act, alleged to have been committed by a public servant i.e. the Judge of the High Court includ ing the Chief Justice of the High Court as in the present case, except with the previous sanction under clause (c) in the case of any other person, of the authority competent to remove him from his office.\nSo to initiate a proceeding against a Judge of a Supreme Court for criminal misconduct failing under Section 5(1)(e), previous sanction of the authority who is competent to remove a Judge including Chief Justice of the High Court from his office, is imperative.\nA Judge of the Supreme Court as well as a Judge of the High Court is a constitutional functionary appointed under Article 124 and under Article 217 of the Constitution re spectively.\nSub article 2 of Article 124 further provides that every Judge of the Supreme Court shall be appointed by the President by warrant under his hand and seal after consultation with such of the Judges of the Supreme Court and of the High Courts in the States as the President may deem necessary for the purpose and shall hold office until he attains the age of sixty five years.\nIt also provides that in the case of appointment of a Judge other than the Chief Justice, the Chief Justice of India shall always be consulted.\nArticle 217 provides that every Judge of a High Court shall be appointed by the President by warrant under his hand and seal after consultation with the Chief Justice of India, the Governor of the State, and in the case of appointment of a Judge other than the Chief justice, the Chief Justice of the High Court.\nSub article 4 of the said article 124 further enjoins that the Judge of the Supreme Court shall not be removed from his office except by a resolution passed by two-thirds of the members of the Lok Sabha and of the Rajya Sabha and the President shall, after being satisfied that the removal is necessary for the proper functioning of the judiciary, by warrant under his hand and seal, remove such Judge from his office.\nSub article 5 of Article 217 further enjoins that a Judge of a High Court shall not be removed from his office except by a resolution passed by two-thirds of the members of the Legislative Assembly and of the Legislative Council of the State and the Governor shall, after being satisfied that the removal is necessary for the proper functioning of the judiciary, by warrant under his hand and seal, remove such Judge from his office.\nTherefore, it is clear that the Judges of the Supreme Court and the Judges of the High Court are completely insulated from prosecution by virtue of the provisions of Articles 124 and 217 of the Constitution and also the sub articles 2, 4 and 5 of the said Articles.\nTherefore, the prosecution of a Judge for criminal misconduct under Section 5(1) of the Prevention of Corruption Act is impermissible.\nLastly, the question whether the High Court of Madras has jurisdiction to try the appeal under Criminal Misc. P. No. 265 of 1978.\nCriminal Misc. P. No. 265 of 1978 was filed in the High Court of Madras and was filed against the Chief Justice of Madras by the present petitioner.\nThe High Court of Madras had jurisdiction to try Criminal Misc. P. 218 P. No. 265 of 1978 because it was filed by the Chief Justice of Madras against the Chief Justice of Madras.\nTherefore, the High Court of Madras had jurisdiction to try Criminal Misc. P. No. 265 of 1978.\nThe High Court of Madras is competent to try Criminal Misc. P. No. 265 of 1978.\nIn view of the above discussions, the judgment of the High Court of Madras dated 27-4-79 in Criminal Misc. P. No. 265 of 1978 is correct.\nThe judgment of the High Court of Madras dated 27-4-79 in Criminal Misc. P. No. 265 of 1978 is correct.\nIn view of the above discussions, the judgment of the High Court of Madras dated 27-4-79 in Criminal Misc. P. No. 265\nActual: A complaint against the appellant, a former Chief Jus tice of a High Court, was made to the CBI on which a case under section 5(2) read with section 5( I )(e) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 was registered on 24.2.1976.\nOn 28.2.1976 the F.I.R. was filed in the court of Special Judge.\nThe appellant proceeded on leave from 9.3.1976 and retired 8.4.1976 on attaining the age of superannuation.\nThe investigation culminated in the filing of charge sheet/final report under section 173(2), Cr.\nP.C. against the appellant on 15.12.1977 before the Special Judge.\nThe Charge sheet stated that the appellant after assum ing office of the Chief Justice on 1.5.1969 gradually com menced accumulation of assets and was in possession of pecuniary resources and property, in his name and in the names of his wife and two sons, disproportionate to his known sources of income for the period between the date of his appointment as Chief Justice and the date of registra tion of the case, and thereby he committed the offence of criminal misconduct under section 5( 1 )(e), punishable under section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947.\nThe Special judge issued process for appearance of the appellant.\nMean while, the appellant moved the High Court under section 482, Cr.\nP.C. to quash the said criminal proceedings.\nThe matter was heard by a Full Bench of the High Court which dismissed the application by 2:1 majority; but granted a certificate under Articles 132(1) and 134(1)(c) of the Constitution in view of the important question of law in volved.\nIn appeal to this Court it was contended by the appel lant that the provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 do not apply to a judge of a superior Court as for such prosecution previous sanction of an authority competent to remove a public servant as provided under section 6 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 is imperative and power to remove a Judge is not vested in any single individual authority but is 191 vested in the two Houses of Parliament and the President under Article 124(4) of the Constitution; that the Parlia ment cannot be the sanctioning authority for the purpose of section 6 and if the President\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInput: (C) No. 677 of 1988.\n(Under Article 32 of the Constitution of India).\nP.N.

'thinner'containing spirit and other soluble material such as shellac in which the percentage of such soluble material does not exceed 30%\" as poison and consequential amendment of rules 12 and 13 of the Rules.\nIt was the con tention of the petitioners before the authorities that their \"unit is manufacturing only those thinners which contain only liquid substance, like as ecotone, ethyl acetate SDS etc.\nand not all solubles.\n\" According to them, therefore, the substance manufactured by them would not come within the amended Rules.\nThough in the beginning the petitioners were contending that in substance manufactured by them did not come within Rule 2(x)(2) and there were some correspondence in this regard, when the competent authority held that the substance manufactured by the petitioners would come within the definition of 'thinner'as contained in Rule 2(x)(2) of the Rules, the petitioners did not question the finding on any material.\nBefore us also they had not placed any materi al to show that the finding was wrong or that the substance would not come within Rule 2(x)(2).\nIn fact the learned counsel argued the petition on the basis that the petition ers are a manufacturer of 'thinner'within Rule 2(x)(2) which has been declared as poison for purposes of the Act.\nOriginally the Act contained a schedule in which the list of substances declared as poisons were listed.\nLater when Delhi Poisons Rules, 1926 were made in exercise of the powers under the Act those list of substances were included in the list enumerated in Rule 2 thereof.\nRule 2 was

A. No. 259/58 the assessee is a public limited company incorporated in the State of Cochin with branches in that State as well as in what was British India and in Travancore State.\nIt filed its incometax return showing an income of Rs. 11,872 for the assessment year 1948 49, its accounting year being the previous calendar year.\nThe Income tax Officer determined its assessable income to be Rs. 90,947 representing only the profit it made in Travancore State and under section 32(1) proviso (1) of the Travancore Act he refused a deduction of Rs. 79,275 shown as loss from branches situate outside the State of Travancore, in British India and other Indian States.\nThe assessee's appeal to the Income tax Commissioner was unsuccessful but the Appellate Tribunal held that the banking business of the assessee being one and indivisible for the purpose of determining the amount assessable to income tax it was entitled to deduct the losses incurred outside Travancore State from the profits accruing and arising in that State.\nAt the instance of the Commissioner of Income tax the following question was referred to the High Court of Travancore Cochin: Is the aforesaid sum of Rs. 79,275 a loss of the assessee arising outside the Travancore State for purpose of the first proviso to section 32(1) of the Travancore Income tax Act? \" This question was slightly modified by the High Court 260 which after referring to several decided cases answered the question in favour of the assessee.\nIn C. A. 260/58 the assessee is a private limited company with its registered office in the former Cochin State.\nIt was carrying on business at its head office in Cochin State and it also carried on business in Travancore State.\nThe assessment was made under the Travancore Act and relates to the previous year ending June 30, 1949, the assessment year being 1950 51.\nThe assesse made a profit in Travancore State and incurred a loss in the State of Cochin and sought to deduct this loss from the profit of Travancore State thus showing a net profit of Rs. 2,643.\nThis was not allowed by the Income tax Officer and on appeal this order was confirmed by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner.\nThe Appellate Tribunal also did not accept the submissions of the assessee and upheld the order of assessment.\nOn an application of the assessee the following question was referred to the High Court of Travancore Cochin: \" Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the loss of Rs. 27,709 arising in Cochin State could be set off against the profit of Rs. 38,998 arising in Travancore State? \" and was answered in favour of the assessee.\nThe Commissioner has come up in appeal pursuant to special leave against both these judgments.\nIt may be noted that the assessee in both the cases is assessed to income tax under the Travancore Act.\nIt is to be observed that the assessment years are 1950-51 and 1951-52 respectively.\nThe main issue in dispute is the applicability of section 32(1) and the first proviso to that section of the Travancore Act.\nSection 32(1) of the Act provides that the profits and gains of any business shall be computed in the manner provided in the Indian Income tax Act 1922.\nThe first proviso to this section provides that nothing in this section shall apply to a business carried on in the former Travancore State or Cochin State.\nThe first proviso to section 32(1) of the Travancore Act applies to a business carried on in the former Travancore State or Cochin State. Therefore, it is clear that it is not the question of applicability of section 32(1) of the Indian Income tax Act 1922 to the assessee but is a question of applicability of section 32(1) of the Travancore Act to the assessee.\nThe assessee is a public limited company carrying on business in the former Travancore State and in British India and other Indian States as well as in the former Cochin State.\nThe business carried on by the assessee in the former Travancore State is a distinct business. This is clearly stated by the assessee in its return of income. The business carried on by the assessee in the former Cochin State is another distinct business.\nThe assessee has shown in its return of income that the business of the assessee in the former Travancore State is a distinct business and has also shown the profit and loss of the business carried on in that State separately. The business carried on in the former Cochin State is also a distinct business and the profit and loss of this business carried on in that State has also been shown separately in the return of income of the assessee.\nThe assessee has shown a loss of Rs. 79,275 in the former Cochin State in its return of income.\nThe assessee has also shown a profit of Rs. 38,998 in the former Travancore State in its return of income.\nThe assessee is entitled to claim the loss of Rs. 79,275 incurred in the former Cochin State against the profit of Rs. 38,998 made in the former Travancore State.\nThis is\nActual: Section 32(1) of the Travancore Income tax Act, which corresponds to section 24(1) of the Indian Income tax Act, 1922, provided : \" Where any assessee sustains a loss of profits or gains in any year under any of the heads mentioned in Section 9 [section 6 of the Indian Act he shall be entitled to have the amount of loss set off against this income, profits or gains under any other head in that year : Provided that where the loss sustained is a loss of profits or gains which would but for the loss have accrued or arisen within British India or in an Indian State and would under the provisions of clause (c) of sub section (2) of Section 18 corresponding to section 14 Of the Indian Act] have been exempted from tax, such loss shall not be set off except against profits or gains accruing or arising within British India or in an Indian State and exempt from tax under the said provisions \".\nThe assessees were companies having their head offices in the erstwhile State of Cochin with branches in the erstwhile State of Travancore and in other places outside the latter State.\nThey made profits in Travancore State but incurred losses in Cochin State and other places, and for the purposes of assessment to income tax they sought to deduct this loss from the profits made in Travancore State.\nThe Income tax Officer acting under the provisions of the Travancore Income tax Act, determined the assessable income representing only the profits made in Travancore State and under section 32(1), first proviso of the Travancore Income tax Act which corresponds to the first proviso to section 24(1) of the Indian Income tax Act, 1922 refused to allow a deduction of the losses incurred.\nThe assessees claimed that the business 257 which they were carrying on was one and indivisible for the purpose of determining the amount assessable to income tax and that they were entitled to a deduction of the losses incurred outside Travancore State.\nThe contention on behalf of the income tax authorities was (i) that under the first proviso to section 32(1) of the Travancore Income tax Act losses incurred in places out I side the State of Travancore cannot be set off against profits made in that State, (2) that though profits and losses in the State arising under the same head could be set off, the proviso, aforesaid, affected not only the generality of\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInput: Appeal No. 1367 of 1980.\nFrom the Judgment and Order dated 19.7.1979 of the Rajasthan High Court in D.B.

Civil Writ Petition No. 769 of 1979 (Surendrapal Singh vs The Board of Revenue for Rajasthan and others).\nThese writ petitions were decided by the aforesaid common judgment.\nThe first writ petition was filed by the father Raghubir Singh whereas the second writ petition was filed by his minor son Surendrapal Singh through his next friend Shri Jagjit Singh, maternal grand father of the minor.\nThe relief claimed in both the petitions before the High Court was the same, namely for setting aside of the order dated 6th August, 1977 passed by the Board of Revenue for Rajasthan, Ajmer.\nThe facts of the case briefly are that proceedings under Chapter III B of the Rajasthan Tenancy Act (Act No. 3 of 1955) (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act of 1955) were commenced for determining the ceiling area for Raghubir Singh.\nThe Sub Divisional Officer, Hanumangarh, by his order dated 10th August, 1972, determined the ceiling area, but an appeal by Raghubir Singh, the Revenue Appellate Authority, set aside the order of the sub Divisional Officer on March 6, 1973 and remanded the case.\nThe matter was taken to the Board of Revenue for Rajasthan by a revision application and the Board by its order dated 14th April, 1975 directed that the ceiling area for Raghubir Singh may be determined according to the old law i.e. Act of 1955 and not according to the new law i.e. Rajasthan Imposition of Ceiling on Agricultural Holding Act, 1973 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act of 1973).\nIn pursuance of the direction of the Board, the Sub Divisional Officer, Hanumangarh, by his order dated 5th May, 1976 held that Surendrapal Singh, (appellant herein) aged 12 years, was a minor son of Raghubir Singh and used to 725 study in Punjab and further held that the land in possession of Raghubir Singh was ancestral.\nThe Sub Divisional Officer, then came to the conclusion that the father and the son constitute two separate units and each one of them was entitled to get 62 Bighas and 8 Biswas.\nIt was thus held that Raghubir Singh and his son Surendrapal Singh are entitled to retain 124 Bighas and 16 Biswas only and the surplus land measuring, 4 Bighas and 6 Biswas may be resumed.\nAggrieved by the order of the Sub Divisional Officer, Raghubir Singh filed appeal before the Revenue Appellate Authority, Bikaner, who by his order dated 6th September, 1976 dismissed the same and upheld the order of the Sub Divisional Officer.\nDissatisfied with the order of the Revenue Appellate Authority, Raghubir Singh filed a revision application under Section 230 of the Act of 1955 before the Board of Revenue for Rajasthan.\nOn behalf of raghubir Singh it was urged before the Board that the petitioner was in possession of 112 Bighas only and not 129 Bighas and 3 Biswas as held by the lower courts.\nHe sought permission to adduce additional evidence in support of his contention.\nThe application for adducing additional evidence was disallowed.\nHowever, the member of the Board came to the conclusion that Surendrapal Singh (appellant here in) was born to Raghubir Singh on 14th March, 1963 and was only 13 years of age when the ceiling proceedings were finalized by the Sub Divisional Officer on 5th May, 1976.\nHe further held that the provisions of the old ceiling law applied to the case but the Sub Divisional Officer had committed an error of law in determining the ceiling area under the new law i.e. the Act of 1973.\nThe Board went on to hold that there is no provision for separate units in Chapter III B of the Act of 1955.\nIn the ultimate analysis the Member of the Board found that there was a gross and patent illegality in the order of the Sub Divisional Officer and, consequently, set aside the order of the Sub Divisional Officer and directed the Sub Divisional Officer to determine the ceiling area according to the provisions of the Act of 1973.\nThe Board also directed that Surendrapal Singh, who was 13 years old at the time of determination of ceiling area, should be given the benefit of the ceiling area available under the Act of 1973.\nIt was thus held that the ceiling area available for Raghubir Singh should be 60 Bighas and 10 Biswas and the surplus land, 4 Bighas and 6 Biswas.\nHowever, the Board also directed that Surendrapal Singh, the minor son of Raghubir Singh, should be given the benefit of the ceiling area available under the Act of 1973 and should be allowed to retain 60 Bighas and 10 Biswas.\nThe Board also directed the Sub Divisional Officer to resume the surplus land of 4 Bighas and 6 Biswas.\nThe judgment of the High Court was, therefore, in favour of the petitioners and against the respondents.\nThe main grievance of the Respondents is that the High Court erred in holding that the provisions of the Act of

to the case\nActual: Proceedings were commenced under Chapter III B of the Rajasthan Tenancy Act 1955 for determining the ceiling area for Raghubir Singh, the father of the appellant.\nIn a revision application in the first round of litigation.\nThe Board of Revenue directed that the ceiling area for Raghubir Singh may be determined according to the old law, i.e. Act of 1955, and not according to the Rajasthan Imposition of Ceiling on Agricultural Holdings Act, 1973.\nThereafter, by his order dt.\n5.5.76, the SDO held, inter alia, that tile father and the son, appellant, constituted two separate units and each of them was entitled to get 62 bighas and 8 biswas.\nAggrieved by the SDO's order, Raghubir Singh filed an appeal before Revenue Appellate Authority, which was dismissed.\nHe then filed a revision application under S.230 of the Act of 1955 before the Board of Revenue for Rajasthan.\nHe urged that he was in possession of 112 bighas only and sought permission to adduce additional evidence, which was disallowed.\nHowever, the Member of the Board held inter alia that the provisions of the old law applied to the case, but the SDO had committed an error of law in determining the ceiling area under the new Act of 1973.\nThe Board further held that there is no provision for separate units in Chapter III B of the Act of 1955, and remanded the case to the SDO, Hanumangarh, for fresh determination of the Ceiling area for Raghubir Singh.\nBefore the High Court, it was urged that the State having not appealed against the order of the SDO dated 5.5.76, it became final, and the Board of 723 Revenue had no jurisdiction to set aside that part of the SDO's order which had gone against the State and in his favour.\nIt was submitted that the power of general superintendence and control over all revenue courts which vested in the Board could not be exercised to the detriment of the writ petitioners much less by way of suo motu exercise of powers.\nThe High Court dismissed the petitions.\nBefore this court it was submitted that the State not having filed an appeal, or a revision, the Board of Revenue could not, while hearing the revision petition of Raghubir Singh, set aside the orders of the SDO and Revenue Appellate Authority under S.221 of the Act\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInput: Appeal

The judgment and order of the High Court dated April 5, 1991, are set aside.\nThe findings recorded by the Trial Court and the First Appellate Court are accepted.\nThe defendants are required to pay the costs of the appeal.\nThe case is remitted back to the High Court for the determination of the amount of costs.

The words \" pendency of any conciliation proceedings\" must be given their ordinary meaning. \" Pendency\" means \"continuing\" or \"on foot\". It means that the proceedings are not concluded and are still continuing.\nConciliation proceedings may be in different stages. They may be at the stage of the initial stages or they may be at the stage of finalizing the settlement. The proceedings may be going on for some time or they may be going on for only a short time.\nIn other words, the proceedings may be in the initial stages or they may be nearing the stage of conclusion.\nTherefore, the dismissal of Louis Pereira on March 18, 1952, could still be said to be in the pendency of conciliation proceedings because the proceedings were still continuing at that date.\nThe dismissal of Louis Pereira could still be said to be in the pendency of conciliation proceedings because the proceedings were still continuing at that date.\nIn the case of Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, it is not necessary for the proceedings to be at the final stage of conciliation proceedings for the proceedings to be said to be pending.\nThe dismissal of Louis Pereira was not merely the conclusion of the proceedings but it was still part of the proceedings which were still pending.\nTherefore, the conviction of accused Nos. 1 and 5 is set aside.\nThere will be no order as to costs.\nKAPUR, J. delivered the judgment of the Court. K. S. Sirajulhuquraini, J. and P. N. Bhargava, J. concurred in the judgment. (This report is a condensed version of the judgment of the Supreme Court) 738.  In the case of State of Maharashtra v. D. K. Basu, (1975) 2 SCC 165, the Supreme Court held that in the case of the conciliation proceedings being in pendency, the employer cannot discharge an employee even for misconduct connected with the dispute.\nHence, the judgment of the Court is by consent.

and the keys of the flat and the motor garage were handed over to the complainant.\nAs the appellant and his wife were leaving the flat, the man, who masqueraded as the complain ant's brother, threw off his disguise and disclosed his identity.\nThe police party, who were down below ready for the raid, held up the car of the appellant and recovered the sum of Rs. 30,500 from the rear seat of the car and also some papers, a typed draft of a partnership agreement be tween the complainant and the appellant and an application form for permission to occupy the building as caretaker.\nFrom the complainant were recovered the bunch of keys and the documents that were handed over to him by the appellant, namely, the letter handing vacant possession (Exhibit D).\nthe receipt for Rs. 2,000 for the articles of furniture (Exhibit E), a letter to the Bombay Gas Company for transfer of the gas connection to the name of the complainant (Exhib it F), and the letter to the Bombay Electric Supply and Transport Committee for transfer of the telephone connec tions and the deposit of Rs. 27 (Exhibit G).\nThe appellant was charged under section 18(1) of the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act, LVII of 1947, for receiving a pugree of Rs. 29,500 and he was further charged under section 19(2) of the said Act for receiving the said sum as a condition for the relin quishment of his tenancy.\nHis wife, who was the second accused in the case, was charged with aiding and abetting her husband in the commission of the two offences.\n421 The defence of the appellant was that he was in search of a partner to carry on his business during his intended absence, who was also to act as caretaker of his flat anal that it was in this connection and with this object in view that he entered into negotiations with the complain ant.\nThe sum of Rs. 29 500 was not paid by the complainant to the appellant but was given to the police as part of the trap, and the sum of Rs. 2,000 was also given by the complainant to the police.\nThe court below found the appellant guilty under both the sections and sentenced him to imprisonment for two years and a fine of Rs. 5,000.\nThe appeal is against the conviction of the appellant and the sentence imposed on him.\nThe main point in dispute between the parties is whether the complainant agreed to pay the sum of Rs. 30,000 and the sum of Rs. 2,000 as consideration for the vacant possession of the flat and the furniture respectively.\nThe complainant is of the opinion that he agreed to pay these sums to the appellant for the vacant possession of the flat and the furniture, and that the payment was made in pursuance of that agreement.\nThe main reliance of the prosecution is on the testimony of the Sub Inspector who was present during the trap and who says that the complainant agreed to pay the two sums of money, the first of Rs. 29,500 and the second of Rs. 2,000.\nThe Sub Inspector is the only witness to the trap and the prosecution case is that the trap was laid by the police to catch the accused in the act of receiving a bribe.\nThe prosecution case is that the complainant was induced to pay the sums of money to the accused by the Sub Inspector.\nThe Sub Inspector is the only witness to the trap and his testimony is the only evidence to support the prosecution case.\nThe court below found that the complainant agreed to pay the sum of Rs. 30,000 and the sum of Rs. 2,000 and that the payment was made in pursuance of that agreement.\nThe main point in dispute between the parties is whether the complainant agreed to pay the sum of Rs. 30,000 and the sum of Rs. 2,000 as consideration for the vacant possession of the flat and the furniture respectively.\nThe complainant is of the opinion that he agreed to pay these sums to the appellant for the vacant possession of the flat and the furniture, and that the payment was made in pursuance of that agreement.\nThe main reliance of the prosecution is on the testimony of the Sub Inspector who was present during the trap and who says that the complainant agreed to pay the two sums of money, the first of Rs. 29,500 and the second of Rs. 2,000.\nThe Sub Inspector is\nActual: Sub section (1) of sec.\n19 of the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act, LVI I of 1947, provided that \"it shall not be lawful for the tenant or any person acting or purporting to act on behalf of the tenant to claim or receive any sum or any consideration as a condition for the relinquishment of his tenancy of any premises\"; and sub sec.\n(2) provided that any tenant or person who in contravention of the provisions of sub sec.\n(1) receives any sum or consideration shall on conviction be punished with imprisonment and also with fine.\nA. who was a tenant of a flat, handed over vacant posses sion the flat to B on receiving \"pugree\", under a document which recited that A shall have no claim whatever over the flat and that B shall pay the rent directly to the landlord.\nA was convicted of an offence under sec.\n19 (2).\nHeld, that there was no \"relinquishment\" of his tenancy by A, within the meaning of sec.\n19 (1) and the conviction could not be sustained.\nThere is a clear distinction between an assignment of a tenancy on the one hand and a relinquishment or surrender on the other.\nIn the case of an assignment, the assignor con tinues to be liable to the landlord for the performance of his obligations under the tenancy and this liability is contractual, while the assignee becomes liable by reason of privity of estate.\nThe consent of the landlord to an as signment is not necessary, in the absence of a contract or local usage to the contrary.\nBut in the case of relinquish ment it cannot be a unilateral transaction; it can only be in favour of the lessor by mutual agreement between them.\nRelinquishment of possession must be to the lessor or one who holds his interest; and surrender or relinquishment terminates the lessee's rights and lets in the lessor.\nAs sec.\n19 of Bombay Act LVII of 1947 creates an offence and imposes a penalty of fine and imprisonment, the words of the section must be strictly construed in favour of the subject.\nThe Court is not concerned so much with what might possibly have been intended as with what has been actually said in and by the language employed in the statute.\nJudgment of the Bombay High Court reversed.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInput: : Civil Appeals Nos 188 to 190 of 1958.\nAppeals from the judgment and order dated November 20, 1957, of the Andhra Pradesh High Court, in Writ Petitions Nos. 1 of 1956, 19 and 470 of 1957.\nA.

Choudhuri, for respondent No. 2. 1959.\nAugust 14.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by DAs C. J.\nThese three appeals are directed against the judgment and order pronounced by a Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court on November 20, 1957, whereby three writ petitions, namely, No. 1 of 1956, No. 19 of 1957 and No. 470 of 1957, which had been filed by the appellant and were heard together, were dismissed with costs.\nThese appeals have been filed with certificates granted by the High Court of Andhra Pradesh.\nThe circumstances under which the three writ petitions came to be filed by the appellant may now be narrated.\nIt is alleged that on January 10, 1942, an agreement was entered into between the Rajah of Venkatagiri and one Sri Balumuri Nageswara Rao whereby the Rajah agreed to give annual leases in respect of certain slate quarries within his estate for five years in succession commencing from February 1942 if the Rajah was satisfied with the work carried on by the lessee during the preceding year.\nIt was 551 further stipulated that if the leases were given continuously for five years, then the lessee would be entitled at the end of the fifth year to obtain a lease from the Rajah for a period of 20 years commencing from the termination of the fifth year.\nOn the expiry of the fifth year, however, the Rajah granted another lease to the said Balumuri Nageswara Rao for a short period commencing from February 1, 1947, and ending on November 30, 1947.\nOn December 10, 1947 the said Balumuri Negeswara Rao is said to have assigned his right, title and interest under the said agreement dated January 10, 1942, to the appelent of the sons of the Rajah.\nThe Rajah on the same day granted a lease for twenty years to the appellant.\nOn September 7, 1949 the Venkatagiri estate was notified under section 3 of the Madras Estate (Abolition and Conversion into Ryotwari) Act 1948 (Madras Act XXVI of 1948), hereinafter referred to as the abolition Act.\nOn the same date the appellant applied to the Collector for confirmation of the lease 'granted by the Rajah to him.\nNothing appears to have happened until February 12, 1952, when a notice was issued from the office of the Board of Revenue (Andhra) calling upon the appellant to show cause within two months from the date of receipt of.\nthat notice as to why the lease should not be terminated without any compensation under the second proviso to section 20(1) of the Abolition Act.\nThe appellant showed cause which apparently did not satisfy the said authorities.\nInstructions appear to have been issued to the manager of the Venkatagiri estate requiring him to take over possession of the slate quarries which were then being worked by the appellant immediately after the expiry of two months'notice issued to him.\nThe appellant promptly filed a writ petition, No. 287 of 1952 in the Madras High Court praying for the issue of a writ in the nature of a writ of mandamus directing the Madras State to forbear from terminating the leasehold right of the petitioner in the slate quarries and from interfering with his possession and working of the slate quarries and other ancillary reliefs.\nThe writ petition having come up for hearing before 555 Umamaheswaram, J:., the learned Judge on July 18, 1955, made an order directing the Government to hold, an enquiry under section 20 of the Abolition Act and decide whether the lease had been granted prior or subsequent to July 1, 1945.\nThe order required the Government to hold the enquiry and pass the appropriate orders within three months from the date of that order.\nThe Board of Revenue caused an enquiry to made by the Director of Settlements who, after taking evidence, oral and documentary, made his report to the Board of Revenue.\nThe Board of Revenue submitted a report to the Government on October 20, 1955, and the Government after considering the Board's report made an order on November 7, 1955, declaring that the lease had been granted prior to July 1, 1945.\nOn the same day the Government ordered the Board of Revenue to terminate the leasehold rights of the appellant.\nOn December 2, 1955, the appellant filed a writ petition, No. 1 of 1956, in the High Court of Andhra Pradesh, praying for the issue of a writ in the nature of mandamus directing the Government to forbear from terminating the leasehold right of the petitioner and from interfering with his possession and working of the slate quarries and other ancillary reliefs.\nThis writ petition came up for hearing before the learned Judges of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh on November 20, 1957, and was dismissed.\nHence, the appeals.\nIn the present appeals the appellant contends that the High Court was wrong in dismissing the writ petitions.\nThe contention of the appellant can be summarized as follows:\n(i) The Rajah granted the lease to the Balumuri Nageswara Rao on December 10, 1947 and the lease was granted to the appellant on the same day and this is a valid grant of a lease by the Rajah under the terms of the agreement dated January 10, 1942, which stipulated that if the lease was granted continuously for five years, the lessee would be entitled to obtain a lease for a period of 20 years.\n(ii) The Rajah on the date of the grant of the lease to the Balumuri Nageswara Rao had no power to grant a lease to any other person for a period of 20 years and such grant would be illegal and ultra vires of the terms of the agreement dated January 10, 1942.\n(iii) The Rajah had no power to assign his right, title and interest under the agreement dated January 10, 1942, to the appelant of the sons of the Rajah.\n(iv) The Government had no power to terminate the leasehold right of the appellant on the ground that the lease had been granted prior to July 1, 1945, under the terms of the Abolition Act.\n(v) The Government's order dated November 7, 1955, was an illegal and ultra vires order.\nThe High Court, on the other hand, has contended that the lease granted to the Balumuri Nageswara Rao on December 10, 1947,\nActual: The principal question for determination in these appeals, arising out of writ petitions filed in the High Court, related to the validity of an order passed by the Board of Revenue (Andhra) terminating the appellant's lease in respect of certain state quarries situated in the Venkatagiri Estate, which had been notified under section 3 of the Madras Estate (Abolition and Conversion into Ryotwari) Act, 1948 (Mad. XXVI Of I948), under the second proviso to section 20(1) of the Act, on the finding that the said lease was granted subsequent to July I, 1945, and was for a period exceeding one year, without giving the appellant three months'notice under the third proviso to that section or providing for compensation under sub section\n(2) thereof.\nThe appellant had also claimed renewal of.\n, the lease under r. 47 Of the Mineral Concession Rules, 1949, which was rejected by the Board as well as by the High Court.\nThe contention on behalf of the appellant, in substance, was that the words \"such right\" in the third proviso to section 20(1) referred to the right mentioned in the second proviso, namely, the right created on or after July 1, 1945, and thus made applicable to it the provision of sub section\n(2)of the section, and before such right could be terminated the provisions of the third proviso relating to notice and sub section\n(2) as to compensation had to be complied with.\nHeld, that the contention raised on behalf of the appellant was without substance and must be negatived.\nThe scheme of the Act was to render all rights created after July 1, 1945, and for a period exceeding one year, ineffective and section 20, properly construed, made it amply clear that its second proviso was a self contained provision that rendered such rights void against the Government and, even if they were voidable and not void, the aid of the third proviso was wholly uncalled for.\nThe third proviso must be held to refer solely to termination of rights created before July i, 1945.\nA.
