      "The case appears to be a judicial proceeding involving a Child in Conflict with Law (CCL) who was allegedly involved in a fatal accident. Here is a detailed summary of the case:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Background:**\n",
      "The CCL, whose age is not specified, had completed his 12th standard examination on May 17, 2024. On the same night, he left his house to attend a late-night party with his friends at a pub. His parents allowed him to go to the pub and consume liquor, and also permitted him to use a Porsche car, which was allegedly not registered as per the rules of the Road Traffic Office.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Incident:**\n",
      "The CCL, who did not have a driving license, drove the unregistered car rashly and negligently, resulting in a fatal accident that caused the death of two people on the spot. The CCL was allegedly under the influence of liquor at the time of the incident.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Proceedings:**\n",
      "The CCL was released on bail on May 19, 2024, with certain conditions, including undergoing psychological treatment and counseling. However, it appears that these conditions were not followed.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Arguments:**\n",
      "The prosecution argued that the CCL's actions had created apprehensions among the general public about their safety on public roads. They also argued that the CCL had become a victim of mob lynching after the incident and that releasing him on bail would pose a moral, physical, and psychological danger to his life.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prosecution further argued that the CCL's parents had neglected their parenting duties and had no control over the CCL's conduct and behavior. They also pointed out that the CCL's friends were allegedly addicted to substance abuse.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Defense:**\n",
      "The CCL's advocate argued that the CCL was already released on bail and that his mental, physical, and social health had been impacted by the incident. They also submitted that the CCL's parents were capable of caring for him and protecting him, and that they had appointed a security team to ensure his safety.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Board's Opinion:**\n",
      "The board, after considering the arguments and the facts of the case, formed the opinion that the CCL had been neglected by his parents and that they had no control over his conduct and behavior. The board also noted that the CCL's friends seemed to be addicted to substance abuse and that the CCL required psychological treatment and counseling.\n",
      "\n",
      "The board further observed that the CCL's parents had allowed him to go to a pub and consume liquor, and had permitted him to use an unregistered car, which was a violation of the Motor Vehicle Act. The board expressed concern that if the CCL was released on bail and handed over to his parents, he would be at risk of abuse at the hands of society and would be exposed to bad company.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion:**\n",
      "The case appears to be a complex one, involving issues of juvenile justice, parenting, and public safety. The board's opinion suggests that the CCL requires rehabilitation and protection, and that his parents may not be equipped to provide the necessary care and supervision. The outcome of the case is not specified in the provided text, but it is likely that the board's opinion will influence the final decision regarding the CCL's custody and rehabilitation.\n"
