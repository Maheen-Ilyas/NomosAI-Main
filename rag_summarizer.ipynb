The prosecution argued that the CCL's release on bail would pose a moral, physical, and psychological danger to his life due to the risk of mob lynching. The prosecution also highlighted the CCL's alleged negligence and reckless behavior, which led to the incident, and argued that his parents' ability to care for him was questionable.\n",

The defense also pointed out that the CCL's parents were capable of caring for him and had appointed a security team to ensure his safety.\n",

The court emphasized the importance of equal justice and the equal protection of the law, regardless of the circumstances of the case.\n",

      "* The CCL was released on bail after an incident, but the prosecution argued that this posed a danger to his life.\n",
